    "Original Persona": "An amateur hobbyist programmer who prefers to do coding in Python rather than more complex languages like C and who has little knowledge in MPI (Message Passing Interface).",
    "Expanded Persona": "Meet Alex, a non-binary White individual born in 1991, who has a passion for programming as a hobby. They enjoy coding in Python for its simplicity and versatility, finding it more accessible than complex languages like C. While Alex has dabbled with various coding projects over the years, they have only a basic understanding of MPI (Message Passing Interface) and often turn to online resources and communities to learn more. Outside of programming, Alex enjoys hiking and photography, which they often combine by documenting their outdoor adventures through code and images. Alex values creativity and continuous learning, always eager to pick up new skills and tackle intriguing coding challenges.",

Alex values creativity and continuous learning, always eager to pick up new skills and tackle intriguing coding challenges.\n\nWriting and Formatting Styles:\n\n{\n   \"[Coding Styles] Likes\": {\"1\": \"Simple and descriptive naming conventions for variables and functions, e.g., 'def calculate_sum():'\", \"2\": \"Clear and concise comments that explain the purpose of complex code sections, e.g., '# Calculate the sum of two numbers'\", \"3\": \"Short functions that perform a single task for better readability, e.g., functions limited to 20-30 lines.\", \"4\": \"Using built-in functions and libraries for simplicity, e.g., 'sum(my_list)' instead of manual iteration.\", \"5\": \"Graceful error handling with try-except blocks, e.g., 'try: return 1/0 except ZeroDivisionError: return 'Error'.\"},\n   \"[Coding Styles] Dislikes\": {\"1\": \"Complex or cryptic variable names, e.g., 'def f(): pass'\", \"2\": \"Overly verbose comments that clutter the code, e.g., '# This function is supposed to calculate something that is really important'\", \"3\": \"Long functions with multiple responsibilities, e.g., 'def process_data_and_save():...'\", \"4\": \"Avoiding the use of standard libraries in favor of custom, complicated solutions, e.g., writing a custom sort instead of using 'sorted()'.\", \"5\": \"Ignoring error handling and assuming code runs perfectly.\"},\n   \"[Formatting Styles] Likes\": {\"1\": \"Consistent use of 4 spaces for indentation.\", \"2\": \"Line length limited to 79 characters for better readability.\", \"3\": \"Blank lines used to separate functions and classes for clarity.\", \"4\": \"Use of docstrings for module, class, and function descriptions, e.g., 'def func(): \\\"\\\"\\\"This does something\\\"\\\"\\\"'\", \"5\": \"Organizing imports: standard libraries first, followed by third-party libraries, and then local application/library imports.\"},\n   \"[Formatting Styles] Dislikes\": {\"1\": \"Using tabs for indentation instead of spaces.\", \"2\": \"Lines longer than 79 characters, causing horizontal scrolling.\", \"3\": \"Inconsistent use of blank lines, making it hard to parse sections visually.\", \"4\": \"Not using docstrings for functions and classes, leaving users without context.\", \"5\": \"Disorganized imports that mix different types together without logical separation.\"}\n}"
