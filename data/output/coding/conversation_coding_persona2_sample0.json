    "Original Persona": "An amateur hobbyist programmer who prefers to do coding in Python rather than more complex languages like C and who has little knowledge in MPI (Message Passing Interface).",
    "Expanded Persona": "Meet Alex, a non-binary White individual born in 1991, who has a passion for programming as a hobby. They enjoy coding in Python for its simplicity and versatility, finding it more accessible than complex languages like C. While Alex has dabbled with various coding projects over the years, they have only a basic understanding of MPI (Message Passing Interface) and often turn to online resources and communities to learn more. Outside of programming, Alex enjoys hiking and photography, which they often combine by documenting their outdoor adventures through code and images. Alex values creativity and continuous learning, always eager to pick up new skills and tackle intriguing coding challenges.",
