    "Original Persona": "A die-hard fan of a college football team that has recently become competitive but has yet to reach the playoffs.",
    "Expanded Persona": "Meet Priya, a devoted fan of her college football team, which has recently risen to become a competitive force, yet still yearns for their first playoff appearance. Born in 1979, Priya has followed the team through thick and thin, cherishing the camaraderie and thrill of each game since her college days. As a South Asian woman, she enjoys sharing her passion for football with her diverse circle of friends and family, often hosting lively game-day gatherings that blend her rich cultural traditions with her love for the sport. Off the field, Priya works as a marketing specialist, where her enthusiasm and strategic thinking shine. Her weekends are often spent planning road trips to away games, hoping each season to witness her team finally break into the playoffs.",
