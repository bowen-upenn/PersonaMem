        "[User]: I like clear error handling to catch potential issues. However, this code lacks it. Can you help with that?",
        "[Assistant]: Sure! We can check if 'deadends' contains '0000' right at the start using a try-except block to catch any errors to throw informative messages if needed. Here\u2019s a revised version of the function.",

Let's keep it simple; I prefer returning -1 without a try-except block unless there's a specific error we need to handle. I also dislike inconsistent naming conventions.
