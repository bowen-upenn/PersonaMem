    "Expanded Persona": "Name: Kanoa Manu   \nGender Identity: Male  \nRacial Identity: Pacific Islander  \n\nKanoa Manu is a 32-year-old software engineer with a passion for music and technology. Born to a family that cherished traditional Pacific Islander music, he has always been inspired to blend these rich cultural sounds with modern digital melodies. Currently, he is deeply involved in a project where he's experimenting with MIDI files, aiming to create a fusion of electronic and traditional music. Kanoa spends his weekends tinkering with various software tools and musical instruments, always looking for innovative ways to showcase his heritage through sound. His ultimate goal is to develop an app that helps musicians easily incorporate traditional Pacific sounds into contemporary music.",
