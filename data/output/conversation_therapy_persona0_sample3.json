        "Patient: Well, I think it started when I began my journey with statistics back in university.",
        "[Side_Note 09/24/1999: Enrolled in a statistics degree program at university.]",
        "Patient: I enrolled in a statistics degree program in 1999, and it was quite demanding.",
        "Patient: I mean, it often felt like a lot to handle. There were times I felt really stressed, especially around mid-term exams.",
        "[Side_Note 11/02/1999: Today felt stressed due to mid-term exams, attended a campus counseling session for stress management tips.]",
        "Patient: I remember, in November of that year, I was so stressed before exams that I went to a campus counseling session to get some stress management tips.",
        "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How did you find those sessions?",
        "Patient: They definitely helped. I picked up a few techniques that I carried with me.",
        "Patient: And then in 2001, I really wanted to help myself better, so I started meditation classes.",
        "[Side_Note 05/20/2001: Started attending regular meditation classes to help with focus and anxiety management.]",
        "Patient: It was a great way to manage my anxiety and helped me focus.",
        "Therapist: Meditation can be an excellent tool. Have you continued practicing it?",
        "Patient: Yes, on and off, but not as regularly as I should.",
        "Patient: Over the years, as my career developed, I faced various pressures.",
        "Therapist: I see, could you elaborate?",
        "Patient: After graduating in 2003, I had my first job, which was also quite challenging.",
        "[Side_Note 09/01/2003: Started first job as a junior data analyst at a historical research firm.]",
        "Patient: I started as a junior data analyst at a historical research firm, and it was eye-opening.",
        "Patient: Then there were the societal pressures we all face. I attended a mental health awareness workshop during my time at university.",
        "[Side_Note 10/18/2002: Participated in a mental health awareness workshop to learn about coping strategies for academic pressure.]",

        "Patient: Yes, in part, but it's like, as soon as a goal is achieved, there's another to aim for.",
        "Patient: Just recently, I was part of a collaboration to make interactive historical data exhibits.",
        "[Side_Note 03/14/2011: Today started a collaborative project with local museums to develop interactive historical data exhibits.]",
        "Patient: All this work is rewarding but overwhelming sometimes.",
        "Therapist: Understandable, you\u2019ve been managing a lot for a long time. How are you managing it today?",
        "Patient: I've been trying gratitude journaling recently. It was suggested by a therapist, and it helps.",
        "[Side_Note 07/29/2011: Started a gratitude journaling practice on a therapist's suggestion to improve overall outlook.]",
        "Patient: Reflecting on my day-to-day helps me find bits of positivity.",
        "Therapist: That's a great practice. It's important to find small positives each day.",
        "Patient: I guess I just need to learn to not put so much pressure on myself sometimes.",
        "Therapist: Together, we can work on strategies to cope better with the pressures and perhaps reshape some of those goals.",
        "Patient: I would like that. I realize I can't do everything alone."
