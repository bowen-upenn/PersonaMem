    "Original Sample": "Subject: Discussion on the new rules and how they might change things\n\nLately, there's been some talk about the new FERC order stuff, and it seems like it might have an impact in the area. Anyway, here's some details on the proposals and my thoughts on whether they affect our existing contracts. Just remember, this stuff is still up in the air and nothing is set in stone yet so don't panic. Eliminating requirement that the California IOUs buy/sell into the Cal PX this one means IOUs can sell directly and not through PX, which seems like a big deal for market trading. I don't know how it will affect things yet, because if everyone pulls out maybe the market becomes an issue. Penalty Charge for Load Deviations Greater Than 5% of Actual Load this one, if the load deviates more than 5%, there's now a penalty charge. Maybe we should recheck who this hits in contracts. Removal of the Existing ISO and PX Governing Boards removing these boards, it's hard to say how this affects contracts but maybe it's a good idea? Interconnection Procedures FERC says there should be new standard tariffs for generator connections, not sure what it means for contracts yet. Long Term Suggestions there's lots of suggestions, including making market rules and developing response programs, but they might not happen so we maybe don\u2019t need to worry about contracts yet. Refunds FERC won't order refunds for before Oct 2, 2000, but going forward there might be requests. Should we do something in contracts about people waiving rights for it? Price Caps FERC suggests a $150 price cap but you can still bid higher, which means we might have to ask parties for info we don't have and this could be a headache. Okay, that\u2019s all for now.\n\nBye,\n\nUnderwater Hockey Enthusiast ",
