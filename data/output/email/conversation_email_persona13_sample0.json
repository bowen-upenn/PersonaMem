    "Original Sample": "Subject: Important Update\n\nHey team, let's chat about how FERC's moves might shake up those Enron contracts we have. FERC's got some thoughts for the California scene. Anyway, I'm just throwing ideas out there.\n\n* n\u00b01 - IOUs & Cal PX: Apparently, IOUs won't have to mess with the PX all the time. This might lead to them getting their hands dirty with more bi-lateral shaky-deals. We could end up with a PX that's super quiet - like a ghost town - and prices there might go all over the place.\n\n* n\u00b02 - Penalties for Load Fluctuations: If loads are super off, they're gonna charge double the ISO price. Gotta dive into contracts to figure out who takes the blame, ya know?\n\n* n\u00b03 - ISO and PX Boards: Clearing house time for those boards, I think. But meh, not our problem contract-wise.\n\n* n\u00b04 - Connecting Generators: FERC wants the ISO to rig up some rules for plugging in new/high-capacity generators. Origination team's headache? Maybe. But it's too early to stress since the jargon isn't even penned down.\n\n* n\u00b05 - Long Haul Ideas: FERC got trigger-happy with ideas like shaking up single-price auctions, dumping balanced schedule requirements, etc. But whatever, it\u2019s all just talk, nothing to do with us...for now.\n\n* n\u00b06 - Refunds Drama: FERC's playing nice till October 2, 2000. After that, refund threats are real till 2002. Should we slip a 'don\u2019t ask for a refund' line somewhere in there for protection? Think about it.\n\n* n\u00b07 - Price Caps Caper: $150 soft cap's on the table, but bids can go wild under certain conditions. How are we supposed to cough up those extra costs as a marketer? Contracts might need a shake-up to demand info from others. Also, hello, confidentiality crisis!\n\nChristian Yoder",
