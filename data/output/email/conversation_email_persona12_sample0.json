    "Original Sample": "Subject: Stuff about California bonds downgrade and energy\n\nHey there, so like, Moody's did this thing with California's General Obligation bonds, and now they're at a Aa3 rating from Aa2. Oh boy, what a bummer! You know, with all that energy crisis stuff going on, it's not looking too good for the economy and all. \ud83d\ude1f\n\nAnyway, there was something about the legislature passing Senate Bill 31. It\u2019s like a whole deal with some revenue bonds for power purchases. But I don\u2019t have all the details right now, but it seems important to mention, right? You get it.\n\nMoody's says these cash advances that the state made for power, I mean, we're talking billions, will keep going up, which is not great, you know? And they\u2019re estimating more spending that might happen, which sounds kinda stressful if you ask me.\n\nTalking taxes, the Governor\u2019s May Revision or something said tax revenues are expected to fall like billions of dollars. Like, hello, that\u2019s a lot! I think some stuff about the high tech sector is behind it. But anyway, more taxes means more spending, and less taxes means...lesser spending, I guess? It\u2019s like this big, complicated thing, and I won\u2019t even try to untangle it here. \ud83d\ude05\n\nSo like, the outlook is still totally negative, but hopefully, California can sort it out? There\u2019s something about making sure the budget is balanced, but who knows how that's going to pan out. It\u2019s all pretty much up in the air for now. \n\nLater!",
