I'm kinda trying to mix in Michelle's emails here. Need the guys in commercial to sort out that \"Attachment X\" mentioned by Michelle in section 2.9. Paul, I put the Credit Support Annex back in case you wanna use it for credit stuff. Guessing you want an Enron Corp. guarantee? Hit me up ASAP with what you think should go to New Power. I'll tweak the doc later to send it out. So, there's some confusion about confidentiality in Section 7.2 because of the whole ENA Wholesale and EES thing. Let\u2019s keep it cool and simple for New Power and EPMI.  \n\nCheers!",
