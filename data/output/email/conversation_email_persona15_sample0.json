    "Original Sample": "Subject: Meeting to Discuss Upcoming Regulatory Changes\n\nDear Sir or Madam,\n\nIn our previous discussions, we have addressed numerous topics which warrant further elaboration. I am reaching out to you today to share updates regarding the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) proposed order and its potential implications on our existing Enron contracts.\n\nBelow is a comprehensive list of the proposed remedies, accompanied by my thoughts:\n\n1. Requirement Elimination: California IOUs will no longer be obligated to buy/sell into the PX. It is important to consider how this could impact market liquidity and pricing volatility.\n\n2. Load Deviation Penalty: A new penalty for deviations greater than 5% has been proposed. We should determine if our contracts have addressed the allocation of such penalties.\n\n3. Governing Boards Removal: Though likely beneficial, the removal of existing boards may not directly influence our contracts.\n\n4. Interconnection Procedures: FERC's directive for standard interconnection tariff provisions could affect future contracts, though current impact is minimal.\n\n5. Long Term Suggestions: Several suggestions have been made by FERC, though their implementation remains uncertain. Current contractual adjustments are deemed unnecessary.\n\n6. Refunds: FERC's stance on refunds before October 2, 2000, does not require adjustments. Consideration should be given to future refunds for unjust rates.\n\n7. Price Caps: FERC's proposed $150 'soft' price cap might necessitate a review of contracts pertaining to index prices, with potential confidentiality issues arising from required information disclosures.\n\nPlease let me know if you require further details or clarification on any of the above points.\n\nBest Regards,\nChristian Yoder",
