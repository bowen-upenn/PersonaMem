I am writing to discuss the upcoming project that involves experimenting with MIDI files for a musical purpose. It's cool! The tempo alteration is possible, but we might face some problems... This probably won't work, and it's crucial to analyze everything carefully. When we impose a price cap, whether from FERC or California with their windfall profits tax, some fundamental questions arise. Without proper testing and evaluation, it\u2019s hard to tell if our methods protect from challenges. We\u2019re in a tight spot, but we must push through. The others in the group are working tirelessly on this, and we\u2019ll get back with results ASAP. This is the best thing ever!!! \u304a\u9858\u3044\u3057\u307e\u3059\uff01",
