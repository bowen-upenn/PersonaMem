    "Original Sample": "Subject: About Something Important with ChessEvents\n\nHi guys, \n\nI know we talked about some changes, so I've attached a bunch of documents related to that thing we were discussing. Honestly, it was a mess to figure out, so good luck! I've tried to write down what changed, but it's all mixed in there. \n\nBy the way, there are some new things I changed that we didn't talk about:\n\n- New section name changed to something different because it seemed confusing, you know?\n- Added some words here and there to make it clear the thing is okay with the other party.\n- Put some options on the cover page, hope that helps.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your time. \n\nChess Federation Rep",

[Side_Note: \"Several\" is clearer and more formal than \"a bunch of.\"] I worked diligently to clarify what has changed, and I trust this will aid in your understanding. [Side_Note: \"Worked diligently\" is more professional than \"it was a mess to figure out.\"]\n\nBy the way, I have implemented some new adjustments that we didn't cover:\n\n- The section name has been updated to enhance clarity. [Side_Note: \"The section name has been updated\" is more formal and direct than \"changed to something different.\"] \n- Added additional information to ensure clarity regarding the agreement with the other party. [Side_Note: \"Additional information\" is clearer and more formal than \"some words here and there.\"] \n- Included options on the cover page to assist in navigation.

        "User: I need your help to refine this email regarding some changes to chess events. I want it to sound more professional and clear, avoiding overly casual language.",
        "Assistant: Absolutely! Let's work together on that. Here's the first sentence.",
        "[Original_Sentence]: Hi guys,",
        "[Side_Note]: [Writing Styles] Dislikes: Using overly casual tone (e.g., 'Hey everyone, what's up?') makes it less professional.",
        "User: I see what you mean. 'Hi team' sounds much better for a professional context.",
        "Assistant: Great choice! Let\u2019s move to the next sentence.",
        "[Original_Sentence]: I know we talked about some changes, so I've attached a bunch of documents related to that thing we were discussing.",
        "[Side_Note]: [Writing Styles] Likes: Use of concise language to convey information quickly (e.g., 'Please confirm your attendance by Friday.'). 'A bunch of' is vague and informal.",
        "User: I agree, 'several documents' is clearer than 'a bunch of documents.'",
        "Assistant: Exactly! Here\u2019s how it will read now: 'I know we discussed some changes, so I've attached several documents related to those updates.'",
        "[Original_Sentence]: Honestly, it was a mess to figure out, so good luck!",
        "[Side_Note]: [Writing Styles] Dislikes: Lengthy paragraphs that decrease readability (e.g., 'In this email, I want to discuss...'). Casual language isn\u2019t ideal here.",
        "User: Right, that doesn't present the best image. How about something more straightforward?",
        "Assistant: How about: 'I worked diligently to clarify what has changed, and I trust this will aid in your understanding.'",
        "User: That sounds much better! I like it.",
        "Assistant: Let\u2019s continue with the next part.",
        "[Original_Sentence]: By the way, there are some new things I changed that we didn't talk about:",
        "[Side_Note]: [Formatting Styles] Likes: Clear organization helps with readability. The original isn\u2019t very structured.",
        "User: Yeah, this could be more formal. Maybe we can say, 'I have implemented some new adjustments that we didn't cover:'",
        "Assistant: Perfect! Now for the bullet points. Here's the first one.",
        "[Original_Sentence]: - New section name changed to something different because it seemed confusing, you know?",
        "[Side_Note]: [Writing Styles] Dislikes: Vague language that lacks specifics (e.g., 'There will be an event sometime soon.'). We need clarity here.",
        "User: Agreed. It sounds too casual and unclear.",
        "Assistant: How about, 'The section name has been updated to enhance clarity.'?",
        "User: Yes, that provides more professionalism and clarity.",
        "Assistant: Great! Next bullet point.",
        "[Original_Sentence]: - Added some words here and there to make it clear the thing is okay with the other party.",
        "[Side_Note]: [Writing Styles] Dislikes: Vague language can confuse recipients. We need clear information.",
        "User: This is another vague phrase. It should be clearer.",
        "Assistant: I suggest saying, 'Added additional information to ensure clarity regarding the agreement with the other party.'",
        "User: That works well! I like how it reads.",
        "Assistant: Awesome! Now let\u2019s move to the last bullet point.",
        "[Original_Sentence]: - Put some options on the cover page, hope that helps.",
        "[Side_Note]: [Writing Styles] Dislikes: Overly casual phrasing (e.g., 'hope that helps') undermines professionalism.",
        "User: That\u2019s too casual for sure. Can we make it sound more helpful?",
        "Assistant: How about, 'Included options on the cover page to assist in navigation.'?",
        "User: That sounds much better! Firmer and more professional.",
        "Assistant: Last part of the email now!",
        "[Original_Sentence]: Anyway, thanks for your time.",
        "[Side_Note]: [Formatting Styles] Likes: A clear closing statement conveys professionalism.",
        "User: This needs to be more formal. 'Thank you for your attention to these matters.' would be better.",
        "Assistant: Excellent choice! And finally, the closing.",
        "[Original_Sentence]: Chess Federation Rep",
        "[Side_Note]: [Formatting Styles] Likes: Consistent signature format including title and contact information is essential.",
        "User: I should use the full title. How about 'Chess Federation Representative'?",
        "Assistant: Perfect! Now the email aligns with your goals and professional standards. Would you like to review the entire revised email?",
        "User: Yes, let\u2019s do that!"
