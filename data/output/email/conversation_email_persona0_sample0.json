    "Updated Writing Sample": "Subject: Investigation Follow-Up\n\n[Side_Note] This greeting is too casual; a more professional approach is preferred.  \nDear Team,\n\n[Side_Note] Replacing \"wanted to drop a note\" with a clearer phrase shows professionalism.  \nI would like to address something important, but there's so much to discuss. It's excellent you sent some info on the Market Monitoring initiative, though it's a bit disorganized at the moment. We didn't anticipate this situation\u2014like who knew the electronic system would have such significant issues? Anyway, Elizabeth mentioned by phone that outside counsel will be in touch.\n\n[Side_Note] Replacing \"I'll be MIA\" with \"I will be unavailable\" increases formality.  \nI will be unavailable from June 30 - July 14.\n\n[Side_Note] The sentence about the electronic system is vague; being assertive and specific is more effective.  \nEveryone thought the electronic system was beneficial, but it turns out it has caused discrepancies. The whole system is undergoing significant changes, and Michael from PX Compliance is understandably concerned. There's a lot of energy in the economy, and it is now reflected in a computer system! I believe we need to address this issue constructively rather than assigning blame; however, we should consider who initiated this project.\n\nBest regards,  \nJohn Doe, City Council Member",
