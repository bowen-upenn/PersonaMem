    "Original Sample": "Subject: Agreement Details  \nDear Madam or Sir,  \n\nI hope this email finds you well. Attached you will find a redlined copy as well as an execution copy of the New Power QSE Agreement, which we have discussed previously. I kindly request your review and subsequent transmission to the appropriate party, Anoush Farhangi of New Power. This communication has been carbon copied to the designated recipients from EPMI as per your directions.  \n\nIt is crucial to draw your attention to the confidentiality obligations contained within Section 7.2 of the document. For your understanding, EPMI is obligated to maintain the confidentiality of New Power's scheduling and settlements information, specifically from EES and its personnel.  \n\nFurthermore, I must emphasize the following:  \n(1) Schedule A requires the completion of contact and payment information by New Power.  \n(2) The Enron Guarantee format was omitted as Schedule E was not included. Pursuant to the Credit Support Annex, each guarantee requires mutual party approval in terms of format.  \n(3) The ERCOT Calendar, although lengthy, will not be included as an attachment. It will be maintained on the MIS website instead.  \n\nShould you have any inquiries or require further clarification, please feel free to reach out at your earliest convenience.  \n\nBest regards,  \nDavid",
