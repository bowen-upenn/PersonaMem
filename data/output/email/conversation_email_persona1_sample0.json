I know from experience that counterparties sometimes need physical transactions, but OPG doesn\u2019t get it. It\u2019s important because otherwise, they\u2019re ignoring a big part of the market. If OPG doesn\u2019t want to do it, just keep going with others. :) The distinction between physical and financial trading isn\u2019t a big deal, but still, some only want physical. There are risks like failing to deliver and costs, but we know that already. I think you\u2019re doing great with others even if OPG doesn\u2019t play ball. This needs to be fixed NOW or else.
