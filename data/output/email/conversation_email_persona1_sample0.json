Please find the attached MIDI file for testing. The file integrates a unique blend of traditional Pacific Islander sounds and electronic rhythms. Specifically, the tempo has been set to 120 BPM to facilitate smooth transitions between sound elements.\n\nHere are some key highlights:\n- Incorporation of traditional drum patterns for authenticity.\n- Layered digital synths to enhance depth.\n- Extensive use of dynamic range compression for clarity.\n\nFor those collaborating on the app development, I've been experimenting with a Python script to streamline the integration. Here's a snippet for preliminary testing:\n\n```python\nimport pygame\n# Initialize the mixer module\npygame.mixer.init()\n# Load the MIDI file\npygame.mixer.music.load('your_midi_file.mid')\n# Play the MIDI file\npygame.mixer.music.play()\n```\n\nLooking forward to your feedback on both the sound and tech aspects!
