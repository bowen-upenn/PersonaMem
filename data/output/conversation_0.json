        "Therapist: Good morning, how have you been feeling since our last session?",
        "Patient: Honestly, it's been a mix of good and not so good. I've been trying to deal with feeling overwhelmed sometimes.",
        "Therapist: Can you tell me more about what's been overwhelming you?",
        "Patient: Ever since I started to push myself more into networking and public speaking, I felt out of my comfort zone. I started attending these workshops and meetups to improve, but I still feel anxious.",
        "[Side_Note: Began attending networking workshops on 01/08/2018 to improve communication skills.",
        "Therapist: Networking can indeed be challenging, especially if it feels unfamiliar. What aspects of these activities make you feel the most anxious?",
        "Patient: It's mostly the fear of not being understood or sounding incompetent. At a tech conference last year, I had to speak in front of a large crowd, and it was nerve-wracking.",
        "[Side_Note: Presented at a local tech conference, his first experience with public speaking on technology topics, on 08/23/2019.",
        "Therapist: That sounds quite challenging. How do you feel looking back at that experience?",
        "Patient: Proud, but also I can\u2019t shake off the anxiety it brings every time I remember the moment. I keep pushing myself though because I think it's important for my career.",
        "Therapist: It's great that you're pushing your boundaries. Have these experiences affected your day-to-day work in any way?",
        "Patient: Yes, in a way. I became a mentor for new engineers at the company and it requires quite a bit of communication. I have to make sure I'm clear and supportive.",
        "[Side_Note: Took on a mentorship role within his company on 09/05/2021 to help new engineers adapt and thrive.",
        "Therapist: Mentoring can be very rewarding but also demanding. How has this role been, considering your introverted nature and your current challenges?",
        "Patient: Rewarding, definitely, but sometimes I feel drained. I spend so much energy making sure I'm doing a good job that I barely have any left for myself at the end of the day.",
        "Therapist: It's important to find balance. How do you typically unwind or recharge after a demanding day?",
        "Patient: I usually spend time reading or just coding for personal projects. It helps me relax and feel more in control.",
        "Therapist: That sounds like a good way to manage stress. Do you feel these activities provide enough balance for you?",
        "Patient: Sometimes, but there are days when even my personal projects feel like a burden. I guess it's because they remind me of work.",
        "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. Let's explore some other activities you might engage in that are completely separate from your work.",
        "Patient: That could help. I've been meaning to pick up a hobby that doesn't involve computers. Maybe painting or joining a music class.",
        "Therapist: Exploring creative outlets can be very therapeutic. It's good to hear you're thinking about this. Shall we discuss how you might start exploring these interests?",
        "Patient: Yes, that would be great. I need something to shake up my routine a bit."
