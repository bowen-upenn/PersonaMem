        "Side_Note: Joined a wellness group on campus that offered mindfulness workshops. 06/23/2011",
        "Patient: They had mindfulness workshops at the group, which helped then, but maybe it\u2019s time to revisit those practices.",

        "Patient: I discussed work-life balance with a therapist last year, but it's still a work in progress.",
        "Side_Note: Discussed the importance of work-life balance with a therapist during a particularly busy period. 07/22/2022",
