Jazz offers a complexity and melody that captivates me, particularly after consuming a lot of pop and mainstream tunes. The improvisational nature of jazz allows for a depth of expression that resonates with my current state of mind. I'm finding that exploring varied musical genres enriches my life in unexpected ways.\nTherapist: What prompted you to focus on jazz? Music can have a profound effect on our emotions and creativity. Often, it reveals layers of our personality that we might not otherwise explore. I'm interested to hear how this particular focus has influenced your mood or creativity. Exploring new musical landscapes can greatly enhance our perspective and emotional well-being."

Understanding your motivations can unveil deeper insights into your values and priorities.
