The way stories can be brought to life through performance really captivates me; it\u2019s like taking a step back in time and experiencing those moments as if I were truly there. Engaging with this kind of storytelling through theater opens my mind to different interpretations of events and pushes me to look deeper into the narratives that shape our understanding of the past. I find myself more motivated to explore history and relate it to my own experiences and to the general fabric of society.",
