        "Side_Note: [Browsing online for rare historical texts.] 08/15/1971",
        "User: For instance, I really enjoy browsing online for rare historical texts. It's one of my favorite pastimes, but sometimes the sheer volume of non-relevant search results can be frustrating.",
        "Assistant: I understand. Filtering search criteria can help narrow down your options to more suitable texts. Have you tried using specific keywords or applying filters such as publication year or author when browsing?",
        "Side_Note: [Purchasing eco-friendly gardening supplies.] 11/01/1971",

        "Side_Note: [Online influencer-driven purchases.] 04/10/1973",
        "User: I tend to ignore recommendations from online influencers because I prefer to make decisions based on my research rather than hype.",
