        "User: They\u2019re thriving! However, I sometimes get frustrated with online clothing shopping. Finding the right fit is a challenge, and I often feel overwhelmed by the size charts and varying measurements across different retailers. It's disheartening to receive something that looks fabulous online but doesn\u2019t fit well when it arrives. The hassle of returns adds to my frustration, and sometimes I'd rather shop in person than navigate through the complexities of online exchanges.",
        "Assistant: Clothing sizes can indeed be tricky! Each brand has its sizing quirks, and it can vary significantly from one retailer to another. You might find it beneficial to explore websites with flexible return policies, which can help ease the stress if you receive something that isn't quite right.
