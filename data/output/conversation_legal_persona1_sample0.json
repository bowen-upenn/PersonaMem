    "Expanded Persona": "My name is David, and I am a man in his early 60s who gradually lost his sight in adulthood. This journey led me to become proficient in Braille, a skill I've found invaluable and empowering amidst the challenges of vision loss. I passionately advocate for the continued importance of Braille in the digital age, believing it offers an essential tactile connection to literacy that technology alone cannot fully replicate. With a background in teaching, I now focus on mentoring others who are adjusting to life without sight, helping them embrace tools like Braille to maintain independence. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and assistive devices, integrating them into my daily activities to enhance my quality of life.",
