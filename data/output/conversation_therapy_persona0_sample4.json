        "Therapist: I see. When did you start to notice these feelings of overwhelm?",
        "Side_Note: Purchased a quaint guesthouse in a picturesque location, transitioning from a corporate job to pursue a passion for hospitality. [03/15/2014]",
        "Patient: I noticed it not long after buying the guesthouse back in 2014. I had left my corporate job, hoping for a shift in work-life balance, but it turned out to be more demanding than I expected.",
        "Therapist: That sounds like a significant lifestyle change. How did you cope with this transition?",
        "Side_Note: Participated in a mindfulness and stress management seminar to handle the pressures of managing the guesthouse more effectively. [04/11/2015]",

        "Therapist: Did anything else help you during that period?",
        "Side_Note: Started practicing daily meditation to improve well-being and focus on guest interactions. [12/05/2017]",
        "Patient: Yes, I also started daily meditation in 2017, which was useful for centering myself before interacting with guests.",
        "Therapist: That sounds helpful. Have you encountered any challenges with staying consistent with these practices?",
        "Patient: Absolutely, consistency has been a struggle, especially during the busier seasons.",
        "Therapist: Can you tell me about any other significant events that might have impacted your stress levels?",
        "Side_Note: Completed a major renovation of the guesthouse to enhance its charm and comfort. [07/22/2016]",
        "Patient: In 2016, I managed a major renovation of the guesthouse, which was as exciting as it was stressful and financially challenging.",
        "Therapist: How do you feel about that experience now?",
        "Patient: Looking back, I'm proud of the results, but at the time, it was overwhelming, and I didn't realize how much it would take out of me.",
        "Therapist: Did you have any support during that time?",
        "Patient: My family and friends were supportive, but I often felt alone in making tough decisions.",
        "Side_Note: Met with a therapist to discuss work-life balance challenges and received strategies for better personal management. [10/19/2018]",

        "Patient: Things like setting boundaries with work hours and prioritizing self-care, but I find myself slipping back into old habits.",
        "Therapist: It\u2019s not uncommon to find it challenging to change habits. Can you recall any times when you applied these strategies successfully?",
        "Patient: Occasionally, I'll manage to implement them, but before long, I get caught up in the day-to-day operations again.",
        "Therapist: Let\u2019s explore a recent scenario where you felt particularly stressed.",
        "Side_Note: Experienced a spike in bookings after a successful social media campaign highlighting guest reviews. [06/10/2022]",
        "Patient: Last year, I launched a social media campaign that was more successful than I anticipated, which spiked our bookings and pushed me to my limits.",
        "Therapist: What did you learn from managing such an increase in demand?",

        "Patient: I joined a local support group for small business owners in 2022, which was eye-opening. Sharing my experiences and hearing others' really helped me feel less isolated.",
        "Therapist: That's great to hear. It seems like connecting with others in similar situations provided some relief.",
        "Patient: Yes, it has, though I still have days where I feel overwhelmed despite the support.",
        "Therapist: It\u2019s important to acknowledge those feelings. How do you usually respond when you feel overwhelmed now?",
        "Patient: I try to step back and take a few deep breaths, reminding myself it\u2019s okay to slow down.",
        "Therapist: That\u2019s a good approach. Maybe maintaining these strategies longer term is something we can focus on in our sessions.",
