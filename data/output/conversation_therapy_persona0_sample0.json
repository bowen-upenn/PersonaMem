        "Side_Note: Started a journal to track emotional and mental well-being amidst academic pressures. [02/14/1992]",
        "Patient: I've started journaling again to track my thoughts, like I did back in college when things got overwhelming.",
        "Therapist: Journaling can be quite beneficial. Have you found it useful in managing stress this time around as well?",
        "Patient: Yes, it's helpful, but the stress is different now. It's more relentless, you know?",
