            "Therapist: I've noticed a shift in your interests recently. How are you feeling about these changes?",

            "Patient: It's a bit of a juggle. I've been volunteering with a local environmental group too. It's fulfilling but means less time at Cin\u00e9polis.",
            "Therapist: It seems like you're really embracing the outdoor lifestyle. Has this change influenced how you interact with your friends and family?",

            "Patient: It has helped a lot. We've been discussing how to balance old and new interests without major conflicts.",
            "Therapist: It sounds like you\u2019re making great strides. Reflecting on your journey, what are some goals you have for the next few months?",
            "Patient: I\u2019m planning to expand my blog and possibly start small group eco-tours.",
