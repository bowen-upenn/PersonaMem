    "Updated Writing Sample": "\"[Side_Note] Using formal tone and introducing a structured dialogue approach with subsections: Ralph addressed Julie with earnest intent, his voice carrying a formal note. 'Julie,' he stated, 'I have affections for you. What seems to be the matter?' Julie avoided Ralph\u2019s gaze. 'Is it that you do not reciprocate my feelings?' he inquired, adopting an analytical approach. Julie sighed, her response measured. 'It's not quite that,' she admitted. 'However, I find myself reluctant to disclose the entirety of my thoughts.' 'You can divulge any concern to me, Julie,' Ralph assured her, his demeanor exuding dominance. In response to Ralph\u2019s affable smile, Julie placed her hand over his, establishing a connection. 'Ralph,' she began with a structured prelude. 'There is a matter I must convey: I am departing.' Ralph withdrew his hand, his countenance contemplative. 'Departing?' he echoed, adopting a tempered and balanced tone, 'I must apologize, Ralph,' Julie admitted, her voice holding a formal tenor. She did not anticipate these circumstances. Ralph maintained eye contact, seeking concise reasoning. 'Please elucidate, Julie,' he requested firmly. 'What motivates your departure from my presence?' 'My return is imminent,' assured Julie, providing a timeline as her parents have arranged for her participation in a summer camp. 'However, rest assured that our paths will converge once more with the advent of first grade.'\"",
