    "Original Sample": "Monica's heels were hurting her. The sharp, pinching pain sprang up from her toes with each step, a constant metronome of irritation. She should have known better- Lot 34 was hell in heels. Too many winding metal staircases, too many giant concrete floored warehouses, and definitely an excess of helipads. Two was usually the maximum. If you could n't get your dastardly deeds done with two helipads, it was time to look for another line of work. She definitely should n't have worn the heels, stuck to sensible flats or even her dressiest pair of sneakers. But Monica was desperate. Lot 34 had been the bane of her portfolio for three years now, stuck there like a bit of hard candy in her teeth, rotting away at the clean bite plate of an otherwise successful career.    There's one more feature I know you're going to love.  She said, marching briskly along another interminably long, poorly lit corridor.  It's truly unique.    The woman that followed her nodded silently. Monica could n't see what kind of shoes she was wearing because of her shoulder-to-floor black cloak, but she did n't hear any muted click of a pair of strappy heels coming from under there. She found herself feeling slightly bitter. Her prospective clients were mostly men, and she honestly had worn the heels because she looked good in them. Very good. But unless this client had predilections that she was hiding very well, sex appeal was not going to aid Monica in this sale.    Here we are.  Said Monica, pushing open a heavy metal door.  The tank.    The two women walked out onto a suspended catwalk above an enormous fish tank the size of a football field. Soft blue light emanated from the calm surface of the tank and the smell of warm, salty water filled the air.    It comes with a little incentive.  Said Monica, walking over to a black box with a large padlock on it.  A free gift from the agency.  She slipped a small silver key into the lock and popped it open. The box's lid was heavy, but she was ready for the weight and lifted it easily. BAR classes three nights a week were n't letting her down. Inside, a cold pile of headless fish lay like silver bouquets. She grabbed one by the tail and sidearmed it out over the water's surface. It spun lazily in the air, glinting in the light, then detonated onto the surface, disturbing the calm water.   Almost immediately, a huge black shape wormed up from the depths of the tank. The water was very clear and its head was visible as it shot towards the surface. A gigantic eel, its broad jaw the size of a compact car, face covered with scales the size of tea saucers. Two glowing green eyes were set on either side of its hatchet face, and they were sparking with hunger. It snapped up the fish with a motion that was nearly faster than the eye could see. In the same movement, it whipped its body back away from the surface, shooting back down into the depths of the tank.    Of course, if you prefer not to keep the eel, you can flush the entire tank out into the ocean and refill it with anything you wish. The sides of the tank are acid resistant and heat resistant well past the point of magma. Although keeping magma at molten heat levels is such a waste of energy in my opinion, and acid lacks the drama of feeding your enemies to a giant eel. It's personal taste, really.    The client was at the edge of the catwalk now, both hands gripping the steel safety bar.    Can I be honest?  Asked the caped woman. This was the first time she had spoken during the whole showing, and Monica was surprised to hear that her voice was soft and pleasant, fairly low with a sensual growl to it. Monica was very glad that the woman did n't communicate through telepathy- she'd had a few clients that insisted doing that and it creeped her out.    I love it.  Said the woman. She turned back towards Monica and smiled almost sheepishly.  I know I'm not supposed to say that to you, it's not an effective bargaining technique.  She shrugged.  But it's perfect.    Monica grinned back at her.  Do n't worry.  She said.  I'm not supposed to tell you this, but the place has been on the market for quite a while. I know the owner is going to be fairly flexible about the asking price.     Fantastic.  Said the woman.  Can I throw it... him? Her? A fish?    Monica nodded.  Of course. ",

The water was clear, revealing its head as it rose. A gigantic eel, with a broad jaw the size of a compact car, and scales the size of saucers.

This was the first time she had spoken during the entire showing, and Monica was surprised by her soft, pleasant voice, with a subtle growl. Monica was glad the woman did not communicate telepathically, which was common among a few clients and unsettling. \n\n\"I love it,\" said the woman. She turned to Monica and smiled, looking almost embarrassed. \"I know revealing this isn't strategic negotiation. But it's ideal.\"\n\nMonica returned the smile. \"Don't worry,\" she said. \"I'm not supposed to disclose this, but the place has been on the market for quite some time. I am aware the owner is willing to negotiate the price.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" said the woman. \"May I throw it... the fish?\"\n\nMonica nodded. \"Certainly.\"",
