    "Original Sample": "Thomas Reed feels itchy. The itch is in the center of his back. He knows he can \u2019 t reach it because it is not a new ailment. Triggered by stress, even if he could reach it and get at the irritating tickle between his shoulder blades, his hands sweat so much he probably could not do much to damage the skin in any satisfactory way. His palms are so soaked that his trousers are now stained wet and oily from his constantly rubbing them on his thighs.   Thomas shouldn \u2019 t have even bothered to show up. He is very much unqualified.   He ca n't even get licensed to drive a car, let alone a spaceship.   Why?   Blind, and he refuses to accept it.   But that is not his only problem.   This interview was an experience he was looking forward to as he walked around Goodwill picking out the clothes he would wear.   A chance to go to space. Be famous. Be something more than himself.   He had picked out the flannel wool blazer and brown slacks, argyle socks and a baby blue cotton oxford shirt, two sizes too big on him, without trying on any of it because they suggested to him clothes an astronaut would wear.   He sprinted through the store looking for the stuff. He was beyond excited.   They called just yesterday afternoon. The call was a quick one.  Hey, can you make it downtown for an interview?  It was a lady on the other end. She sounded happy for him.    Of course,  he replied.   He was so certain he would be offered the job he even called work and quit.   No way he was going to give any more energy over to the restaurant. He needed to look dressed and refreshed.   This morning he had his usual issue getting the neck closed on the shirt. Being cut too big it was so large on him he almost thought about using a safety pin to stop it from drooping, exposing his fat covered collarbone area.   He decided the only thing to do would be to cinch his tie tight. That really helped, but it still looked wrong. Fastening the buttons on his blazer would have done some good also, but he bought a child sized jacket. It looked comical on him, but he was committed and had worn it anyway.   Four months ago Thomas Reed applied for the job. It was not that he was n't working, he had a fine position at the local McDonalds. His manager called him the best cashier she had ever seen. Not a compliment in his mind, but at least he felt like he had job security.   To go to space though, it was the stuff of dreams, if he did n't take this shot he would never forgive himself.   On complete coincidence he spotted the advertisement while sucking down some brews one night and surfing the internet for porn.   The qualifications seemed outlandish :   Bachelor's degree.   Ha, he did n't even make it through the tenth grade.   1,000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft.   Nope, Thomas had never even flown in a plane, let alone commanded one.   Ability to pass a space physical.   Whatever that means.   Thomas considered himself to be in tiptop shape. He has never been to the doctor in his adult life.   He was thirty-six and only got sick like four times a year. When the seasons changed and only for a week or two.   He was also what one would call a short guy. Most people looked down at him when he took their orders. He looked up to most women. And when he walks in to places with the little rulers by the door he immediately gets embarrassed.   But shorter has to be better right? In space, in tight quarters, would n't his crewmates prefer a pudgy mini sized astronaut to one of the behemoth superstar athletes taking up double space with just their shoulders alone? Also he was very floatable. In a pool he is so fluffy touching the bottom is not possible.   To a rational person none of this would make sense.   So why did Thomas think that he could be an astronaut?   Because he could do hardcore math problems in his head.   Deb, his manager, has even told him she has never had another employee ever not turn in a drawer that was off. And he was never off. Even by a penny. He has even caught all the managers he has worked for miscounting.   But not him.   Somewhere along the way he heard math and space go hand in hand.   How?   He has not even the remotest of ideas.   So he told some lies on the application.   PHD Math.   If asked what a PHD was he probably would say it has to do with physical education.   1000 hours command time in an F-16.   Why an F-16?   He knew it was a plane that held missiles and that was pretty much it. He looked at a picture book once with planes in it. That was one of them. How many people looked at planes in picture books?   Probably not many.   With every lie he typed into the computer the better he started feeling about himself. It \u2019 s not that he believed any of it, only that it could be true.   If he had just been luckier.    Waiting to get his turn at an interview he sits and thinks about his application, but he should be looking around the room. Comparing himself to those around him.   In that he is short, round and very conventionally ugly, he makes those sitting at attention in the large lobby of the Office Center that much better looking.   The confidence of the other candidates should make Thomas want to run away completely broken for the rest of his life at how out of place he really is competing for an opportunity to fly into space.   If it were n't for his math skills that is.   \u201c Thomas Reed? \u201d   He looks up. The woman who calls his name is impossibly beautiful, blonde, with glowing skin and a runners body. She is looking around the room expectantly. Her eyes slide over him as if he were a bag of trash waiting to be taken to the dumpster.   She is the type of woman Thomas would normally be unable to even look directly at.   Today though is different.   He attempts to wipe his hands dry on his pant legs one last time. He ignores the squish of wet material and stands. The sudden release of pressure on the vinyl seat causes it to flatulate. Thomas does n't hear it though as he heads directly to the startled woman with blue sparkling eyes extending his hand.   \u201c I am Thomas Reed. \u201d   The woman turns ignoring the sweating hand and beckons over her shoulder for Thomas to follow.   He does, proud of himself for being able to approach this person several times out of his league. He feels like things are getting better. Maybe today is really the first day of the rest of a new life.   She guides him through an area filled with small walled cubicles. They end their journey at a glass wall enclosed conference room.   She opens the door. It wooshes.   \u201c Please have a seat. \u2019   He does and places his wet hands on the table so as not to have to feel his soft under muscled thighs through his ruined pants.   \u2018 We are running a bit behind, so please be patient. \u201d   He nods as if he completely understands.   She follows his nod with a withering look.   Thomas misses it. As confident as he feels he still does not have the ability to make eye contact.   The receptionist leaves him alone. After several minutes of acting patient he starts looking around at the office space.   The conference room is in the center of a sea of cubicles. Occasionally he catches one of the workers looking over at him. They quickly avert their glance when they notice him looking back. Other than the sea of desks there is little else to look at.   Thomas starts to get bored.   His seat is comfortable.   The air is cool.   After a while he feels his eyes get droopy. He has never been good in situations where he was n't given constant stimulation. Just on the verge of sleep the glass door opens with a whoosh and two men step through. They could be twins. Both wear black suits of modest value, have close cropped brown hair and hazel eyes that seem to catch everything.   They sit opposite Thomas. Nothing even resembling emotion shows on their faces. After a small moment of observation they turn to each other and smirk.   \u201c Thomas, what do you know about Mars One? \u2019   ",

    "Updated Writing Sample": "[Side_Note] This reflects a professional and technical tone.\nThomas Reed experiences an uncomfortable sensation on his back. As a regular occurrence triggered by stress, it's beyond his reach, and his sweaty palms indicate a physiological response that makes alleviating it unlikely.\n\nThomas's presence here today might be ill-advised. His qualifications are significantly lacking.\n\n[Side_Note] This reflects objectivity, leaving personal value judgments aside.\nHe is unable to obtain a driver's license, let alone pilot a spacecraft. The primary reason is his blindness, a fact he struggles to accept. \n\n[Side_Note] Maintaining an objective and factual tone without emotional embellishment.\nThat's not his only concern. This interview was an opportunity he anticipated while selecting attire at Goodwill, envisioning potential fame and a transcendent life opportunity. \n\nHe chose a flannel wool blazer, brown slacks, argyle socks, and a blue cotton shirt\u2014two sizes too large\u2014without trial, associating them with an astronaut's attire.\n\nHis excitement was palpable during the brief phone call for attendance confirmation scheduled for today. The call, conducted by a positive-sounding lady, left him assured of his imminent employment. So certain was he that he resigned from his restaurant job immediately, redirecting his energy and focus towards appearing presentable and rested.\n\nThis morning's struggle centered around adjusting his oversized shirt's collar, considering a safety pin for enhanced fit but ultimately tightening his tie. Despite the comedic effect of a child-sized blazer, commitment propelled him to proceed with it.\n\nFour months ago, Thomas submitted his application\u2014not due to unemployment, as he held a secure position at McDonalds, where his manager commended his unmatched proficiency as a cashier. Rather, the allure of space necessitated this attempt, a decision spurred by aspirations seen while browsing online one night.\n\nThe application checklist was ambitious:\n\n- Bachelor's degree\n(Note: Thomas\u2019s education ceased post-tenth grade)\n- 1,000 hours in-command pilot time in jet aircraft\n(Thomas has yet to experience passenger flight)\n- Capability to pass a spatial physical exam\n(Considered irrelevant due to self-assessed health and fitness; rarely sick, thirty-six years old)\n\nAt a modest stature, Thomas deemed his size advantageous for space travel, assuming space comes at a premium. Though incongruous, his physique was buoyant and deemed potentially beneficial.\n\nReasoning motivated by mathematical capability reaffirmed his ambition; consistent cash-drawer accuracy showed potential transferability to computational space-related tasks.\n\nHe exaggerated qualifications entered online:\n\n- PhD in Mathematics\n(A perceived mix-up with physical education)\n- Command time in F-16 aircraft\n(Selection based on familiarity from visual media content)\n\nDespite questionable credibility, he curated a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reflecting potential realities contingent on serendipity.\n\nDuring the wait for his interview, comparison to other aspirants highlighted disparity, but his mathematical acumen provided solace from feeling inadequate.\n\n\u201cThomas Reed?\u201d \n\nHe responded, facing the impossibly attractive blonde woman, her attention momentarily skipping him like disregarded waste. Customarily intimidated, today allowed unexpected boldness.\n\nWiping sweaty palms on trousers, disregarding the moisture, he rose. A vinyl seat sound unnoticed, he approached the woman confidently.\n\n\u201cI am Thomas Reed.\u201d \n\nShe turned, disregarding his offered hand, inviting him to follow. Her presence emboldened his resolve, leaving him optimistic about future prospects.\n\nTraversing cubicles, they concluded at a glass-walled conference space. \n\nShe executed the door\u2019s opening, ushering him in with efficiency.\n\n\u201cPlease have a seat.\u201d\n\nHe complied, positioning moist hands on the table avoiding friction against saturated trousers.\n\n[Side_Note] The concise breakdown of dialogue provides clarity in the text structure.\n\u201cWe are running a bit behind, so please be patient.\u201d \n\nWith understanding, he nodded, internalizing but unable to reciprocate direct eye contact.\n\nThe receptionist exited, leaving Thomas to his observations. Surrounded by cubicles, sporadic glances from occupants quickly averted under reciprocal observation. The environment\u2019s monotony suggested due to intermittent distraction\u2014but not for long.\n\nIn relaxation, near sleep, the door swung open. Entering were two indistinguishable men, modestly attired, hair uniformly cut short, with observant eyes. \n\n Seated opposite Thomas, their faces expressionless, they momentarily exchanged subtle amusement. \n\n\u201cThomas, what do you know about Mars One?\u201d",
