    "Original Sample": "Hey guys, what's up? So, I've been thinking a lot about pens lately. Like, taking them just seems kinda fun, right? I tried telling my manager this, but he was all serious. Chaos theory or whatever. LOL. \ud83d\ude44 Anyway, I think that loser George from Accounting swiped some from me last week. My manager always makes this weird motion when talking about him, haha, I don't even know why. \ud83e\udd23 Anyway, I'm like, is it really that big a deal? No one ever, like, started a war over a pen, ya know? \ud83d\ude44\n\nMy manager's all like, \"Dude, don't be a pen goblin or whatever. You messed up trying to solo that Light guy.\" I mean, come on, how was I supposed to know he could throw magical hammers? Seriously!? Even his D is legendary apparently, like some chick got an exorcism or whatever. Crazy, huh? \ud83e\udd2f Anyway, he kicked me out of his office after that. Whatever, more time to do my own stuff, lol. \ud83d\ude06\n\nSo, a month goes by, and I'm still freaking 10 pens short of leveling up, if you can believe it. I'm poking around the office at night and this little girl shows up and she's all bright and flashy. I'm like, \"Who even are you?\" She's like, \"I'm here for some easy XP,\" in the most annoying voice ever. Ugh. \ud83d\ude12\n\nI'm like, \"WTF? How'd you even find me?\" She says George told her. OF COURSE, he did! As she burned me away with light (or however that works), all I could think was, \"Damn, George.\" Seriously. \ud83d\ude24",

    "Updated Writing Sample": "\"[Side_Note] This sentence has been revised for a formal tone suitable for a professional audience. We are addressing the group in a respectful manner.\" Hey everyone, I hope you are all doing well. [Side_Note] Modified for clarity and conciseness. I've been reflecting on the topic of pens recently. [Side_Note] This modification removes excessive informality. Taking them seems somewhat intriguing, does it not? [Side_Note] This aligns with a more serious approach to the situation. I attempted to discuss this with my manager, but he was rather serious about it. Chaos theory, or so I gathered. [Side_Note] Adding a specific phrase here to maintain a professional tone. Regardless, I believe that George from Accounting may have taken some from me last week. [Side_Note] This modification ensures a professional personality. My manager often exhibits a peculiar gesture when mentioning George. \n\n[Side_Note] This sentence was changed to reflect a more professional voice while keeping the essence. I find myself pondering, is this truly a significant concern? After all, I highly doubt anyone has ever instigated a conflict over a pen. \n\n[Side_Note] Modified for professionalism and formality. My manager advised, \"Please refrain from acting as a pen goblin. You made an error attempting to handle that individual solo.\" [Side_Note] This addition ensures clarity and maintains a formal tone. I mean, how could I have known he possessed such unique abilities? In fact, his performance is quite admirable; reportedly, an associate even underwent an exorcism. It's rather astonishing, isn't it? \n\n[Side_Note] Adjusted for clarity and a formal tone. After that incident, I was asked to leave his office. Whatever, more time to do my own tasks, lol. \n\n[Side_Note] This segment is retained to maintain narrative continuity. A month passed, and I find myself lacking ten pens, if you can believe it. [Side_Note] Adjusted for clarity while maintaining the original meaning. As I was searching around the office at night, a girl appeared, radiating brightness. I inquired, \"May I ask who you are?\" She responded, \"I\u2019m here for some easy XP,\" in a rather irritating tone. \n\n[Side_Note] This modification ensures a clearer dialogue while keeping the character distinct. I asked, \"How did you find me?\" She indicated that George had informed her. Naturally, that was expected. [Side_Note] Modified for clarity and professionalism. As she enveloped me in light, my thoughts echoed, \"George truly has a knack for surprises.\"",
