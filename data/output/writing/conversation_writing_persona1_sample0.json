I needed a place where I could relax. Somewhere where I could feel like I fit in.

Everyone there bought it, even the guys I played cards with in the local bar. It was a small town. Soon enough, I knew everyone and everyone knew me.   That's when fate decided to punch me in the gut.   A Ferrari drove by me one day, as I was walking down the main street. I could still hear it whizzing, far up the little mountain that the town rested upon, as I pushed open the door of the bar.     Avez-vous entendu que?  I said to the bartender, who was named Guy. He nodded, and told me that some rich guy had bought the biggest house in La Rouge, which used to belong to a little old lady. It was at the top of the mountain.  ",
