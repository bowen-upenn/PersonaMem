Seaweed was entangled and disentangled in the taut cables as they laboriously retrieved an unidentified object from beneath the sea. The spectators, intent on their observation, were oblivious to the surrounding environment; the gentle rhythm of the waves, the whispering tropical breeze, the palm trees' distant rustle, the golden sand, and the clear aquamarine waters were dismissed as irrelevant distractions. The stern setup, with Marines firmly holding their positions and weapons, ensured security against any uninvited access attempts. VIPs present were enveloped in confidentiality, the object guarded under strict secrecy, and a sergeant with a lingering hangover added tension to the already cautious atmosphere. Several scientists, exuding superiority, fixed their studious gazes on the water, masked in scholarly patience, despite their uncertainty about the situation\u2019s outcome. Jedgar, resolute in his authoritative role over all U.S. security and police forces, focused intently on the water. His mind, however, was burdened with resentment toward the president. It was bothersome to be diverted for historical interests when an engagement at the racetrack, involving a significant monetary transaction, beckoned him. Bennie the Dip might squander or fail to meet the arrangement, and here was Jedgar, supervising another\u2019s enthusiastic pursuit. The tension continued to escalate within him. Bennie better adhere to the arrangement. Jedgar cast a glare at the water as if questioning its very presence. On the opposite side of the cables, a young individual in scuba attire sat dejectedly. He rotated his helmet and mask anxiously. Despite his courage before oceanic creatures, facing U.S. officials was an entirely different ordeal. The government\u2019s involvement was daunting. Reflecting on his unfortunate circumstances, he internally lamented his decision to share information. He had funded his explorations independently, even down to gas and air for his bike. Regardless, there were legal frameworks for ownership, and abandoning at this point seemed premature. Resolved for one last attempt, he adopted an internal resolve, mirroring perhaps how a cinematic hero such as John Wayne might confront a challenge. He maneuvered beneath the cables. Addressing Jedgar took priority. Yet, Jedgar remained uninterested, maintaining focus on the water. Courage gathered, the young man asserted, \u201cThis belongs to me! It\u2019s my discovery. Without my intervention, its existence would be unknown to you!\u201d Jedgar\u2019s attention remained unbroken by the speech. He mechanically reached out, dismissing the young man aside. The lead scientist observed the exchange, although slightly inconvenienced. Normally not wearing prescription lenses for image sake, he glanced over. Employing his patronizing tone reserved for subordinates marked for dismissal, he condescendingly explained, \u201cYou must understand. Such discoveries transcend personal claims. They belong within the domain of science, destined for educational institutions and museums.\u201d Detecting the altercation, Jedgar withdrew his attention from the ocean, directing his imposing gaze upon the young man. With assertive confidence, he seized the young man\u2019s scuba suit. \u201cAnother protest from you,\u201d Jedgar enforced strict control, \u201cand you\u2019ll face charges for conspiring to illicitly acquire archaeological imports. Section 896 entails three years of incarceration. Abstain from any further public disclosure! Neither to companions, nor to media personnel!\u201d He dismissively flung the young man aside, resulting in the young man's fall. \u201cThis is governed as a state affair,\u201d Jedgar declared officially. Demoralized, the young man observed the industrious scuba diver. Sympathy was absent within the government ranks or the Marine unit. Even the scientific community was indifferent. Feeling overwhelmingly isolated, he withdrew, departing from the secure perimeter back to the uninvolved crowd. The cables continued their arduous task. The viewing congregation maintained their vigil. Emerging into visibility was a metallic object, encrusted with marine deposits. Devoid of seams or bolt heads, its symmetrical, multi-faceted structure gradually became discernible. With its full eight-foot dimensions displayed, it captivated the assembly. \u201cPrepare for the object's transportation aboard the aircraft!\u201d announced Jedgar decisively. Perhaps there was still an opportunity for the racetrack appointment. Resplendent Washington, the epitome of civic integrity and social justice, basked in the summer warmth, yet remained firmly beneath the influence of financial sectors and their enforcement entities. The Institute, strategically positioned, was steadfastly associated with the printing operations feeding wealth to selective recipients. A limited summer glow pierced the smog, illuminating a substantial hall, centrally dominated by the object. Its full dimensions, polished to some extent, with sand residues eradicated, presented itself, seemingly scrutinizing the vicinity with its sealed fa\u00e7ades, suggestive of concealed apertures and dormant anticipation. \n```",

    "Original Sample": "The winch on the truck wound inward,  growling and snapping and groaning. Seaweed  whipped and wound and unwound on  the taut, protesting cables as they dragged  an object toward the beach from under the  sea.  The intensity of the watching group  had no eye for the beauty of the scene ; the  soft purling of the small waves, the soothing  whisper of the tropical wind, the distant  clatter of a palm, the rich gold of sand and  crystal aquamarine of water might as well  have been a tourist poster in a waste basket.  The rigid cordon of Marines, facing  outward, automatic weapons in hand, had  fierce eyes against any threatened intrusion  into the site. VIPs that must not be approached,  an object that was top secret and  a sergeant with a hangover increased their  trigger-happy vigilance.  Several supercilious scientists gazed  benignly at the water, tolerantly and learnedly  waiting for the object to appear, hoping  no one had penetrated the fact that they  hadn \u2019 t a clue.  Jedgar, the jut-jawed czar of all US police  and security forces scowled with ferocity  at the water.  God damn president, he ought to have  his ass kicked, getting him out here for  what. God damn hobby-happy bastard. So  it \u2019 s an historical find. So it may be from  outer space. Sand fleas when he had an appointment  at the race track with Bennie the  Dip. $ 30,000 payoff via the window.  Damned junkie, he \u2019 d probably blow it or  forget it. What the hell was he doing out  here playing nursemaid to his nibs \u2019 crap  hobby? Nursemaid, that \u2019 s what he was.  God damn president. Bennie better pay up.  Jedgar glared at the water as though about  to arrest it on suspicion.  On the other side of the groaning cables  sat a disconsolate young man in a scuba  suit. He twisted his helmet and mask in his  hands around and around. While he might  have the nerve to face the monsters of the  deep, what were those compared to US officials.  Damned government. He ought to  have kept his mouth shut. No breaks. He  always lucked out. Here he \u2019 d made the find,  personally and privately and even paid for  his own bike gas and air. Well, an orphan is  an orphan. Still, there was law about ownership.  You couldn \u2019 t give up just like that.  One more try. If it didn \u2019 t work\u2026  The young man braced himself, got to  his feet and wiped some of the sand off his  pants. How would John Wayne handle this  on the late-late show? One more try.  The young man ducked under the  growling cables and walked up to Jedgar  who gave him not a glance.  Now or never. \u201d It \u2019 s mine! I insist it \u2019 s  mine! I found it. If it weren \u2019 t for me you  wouldn \u2019 t even know of its existence! \u201d  Jedgar did not even take his eyes off  the water. He put out an arm and brushed  the young man sideways.  The leading scientist of the group found  his own view obstructed. He never wore \u201c  glasses despite needing them as they  spoiled his image of the tawnymaned man  of science. He peered at the young man. In  his benign voice, reserved for assistants he  intended to fire, he said, \u201d You don \u2019 t understand.  Such finds as this belong to the world  of science, to the museums, to the universities. \u201d  Having registered now that there was a  dispute, Jedgar tore his eyes from the water  and stabbed them at the young man.  Reaching out with a sudden and practiced  cop hand, he seized the front of the young  man \u2019 s scuba suit.  \u201d You give me any more crap, \u201d Jedgar  yanked the young man close to him, \u201d and  you \u2019 ll be charged with conspiracy to steal  archeological treasures. Section 896. Three  years in jail. Not one more word out of you.  Not to the public! Not to your friends! Not  to the press! \u201d He hurled the young man  from him violently so that he staggered and  fell.  \u201d This, \u201d pronounced Jedgar, \u201d is a state  matter. \u201d  The young man looked up from the  ground, defeated. He looked out to where a  government scuba diver was guiding in the  cables. There was no sympathy there. He  looked at the tense Marine backs. He  looked at the scientists. He looked at Jedgar.  He was totally, completely and utterly  ignored. He had never felt more lonely.  He got up and unsteadily wandered  across the sand. Head down, shuffling, he  went out through the cordon and wandered  away through the distant crowd.  The winch cables groaned on, coiling  and twisting. The government scuba diver  watched the cables. The group on the sand  stared, waiting.  A greenish sea-coated metal object began  to emerge.  It had no bolt studs, no apparent  seams. It was many planed, symmetrical.  First one, then two, then a the eight foot  diameter of it came into full view.  \u201d All right! \u201d yelled Jedgar. \u201d Let \u2019 s get the  thing loaded on a plane. \u201d Maybe he could  still get to the race track.  Washington the fair, Washington the  beautiful, home of the incorruptible politician  and the shining knights of social justice,  basked in the summer sun, owned, operated  and controlled as usual by the bankers and  their police.  The Institute sat on a low hill, securely  backed by the printing plant that poured  the newly printed money into the hands of  the deserving few. As much summer sun as  could get through the smog entered the windows  of a large hall and fell upon the object.  All eight feet of it had been placed  against one wall. It had been polished up a  bit \u2013 at least the sand had been removed. It  had two small panels, oblong sealed rectangles,  much like slitted eyes and these  seemed to stare blindly into the hall facing  it, waiting.   Dang it, how did you get me to republish the Scientology story,  Revolt in the Stars ?"
