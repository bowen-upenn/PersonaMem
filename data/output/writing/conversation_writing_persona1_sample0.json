Others will make you smart. \u201d   Although the words leave my mouth, they aren \u2019 t actually mine. I've already been led astray. She might still hold a chance.   \u201c The others are stupid! \u201d Her voice has a tone of protest, which is a bad sign.   \u201c Please honey don \u2019 t you trust your own father? \u201d I lift her up, trying to please her.   \u201c Lem me go! \u201d She is wriggling in my arms.   \u201c Listen to me now, \u201d my arms bring her back to the ground, \u201c forget what the teacher said. \u201d I kneel and begin to whisper.   \u201c Thinking is not something the people approve of dear, \u201d I nervously look around, checking the inside of my own house. Nowhere is safe, especially not your home.  \u201c So you better keep for from it, even when it's day time it is best not to think too much, do you understand? \u201d I try to sound as serious as I can.   She glances at her feet, not sure what to answer.   \u201c No. \u201d   She must \u2019 ve been thinking about why she isn \u2019 t allowed to think. Damn I should \u2019 ve disabled her thoughts before I told her all this. I can \u2019 t disable it now without avoiding questions tomorrow. I \u2019 m such an idiot.   I let out a sigh.   Crap now I \u2019 m thinking as well. Better get this over quickly.   \u201c You don \u2019 t need to understand why, you need to just accept, \u201d I elaborated.   \u201c When you can just accept, you do not need to think. It makes for a much more relaxed life. \u201d  She just nodded.   I can \u2019 t believe I \u2019 ve been forced by this teacher to use such lies. Now that she showed a bit of understanding I turn of her ability to think.   \u201c Alright then, off you go to bed! \u201d And as I push her upstairs, I hear the doorbell.   My heart stops for a second. I see Katy hesitate on the stairs. I tell her I love her and gesture her to move on. She follows my order without questioning and for the first time in my life, I thank the government for thought manipulation.  The noise at the door gets louder. I wipe a tear from my face and aim my attention at the door.   \u201c Yes yes, I \u2019 ll be right there, \u201d I take the keys and take a deep breath. I knew it would be inevitable, but I had never thought that a stupid teacher would be the cause.   Running is n't an option. It never was.   I open the door and immediately I get thrown on the ground. I get cuffed as if I'm a serious criminal. Three policemen hold me in my place, until one of them yells in my ear.   \u201c You are under arrest for unauthorized use of the thoughts system and suspect for rebellion. Anything you say can and will be used against you. \u201d   It didn \u2019 t matter to speak now, or later. I will be convicted all the same.    We are going to shut your thinking down now.    And they do. All of them... "
