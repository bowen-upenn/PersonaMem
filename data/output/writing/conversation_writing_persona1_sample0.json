    "Original Sample": "The nuts and bolts of my job are n't what gets to me. Killing, blackmailing, kidnapping, the like. It's the isolation part that really hits me. I needed a place where I could relax. Somewhere where I could feel like I fit in.   In an airport bathroom, somewhere, while was squeezing into a steward's uniform I had just acquired, I heard a man talking about this little town in France called La Rouge. He made it sound nice, so I went after I finished the job.   With the very little French I knew, and a decently worked out backstory, I passed as a writer living in early retirement, in La Rouge. Everyone there bought it, even the guys I played cards with in the local bar. It was a small town. Soon enough, I knew everyone and everyone knew me.   That's when fate decided to punch me in the gut.   A Ferrari drove by me one day, as I was walking down the main street. I could still hear it whizzing, far up the little mountain that the town rested upon, as I pushed open the door of the bar.     Avez-vous entendu que?  I said to the bartender, who was named Guy. He nodded, and told me that some rich guy had bought the biggest house in La Rouge, which used to belong to a little old lady. It was at the top of the mountain.  ",
