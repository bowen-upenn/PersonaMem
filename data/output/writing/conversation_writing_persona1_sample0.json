She\u2019s at home being all cute and stuff asking if I\u2019ll be there for dinner, while my wife is doing the whole comforting thing. Belle\u2019s got that brown hair you know? So soft.

They were laying it on thick, not that I really knew how true any of that was. Gram, he was chill, but yeah, not like some superhero. This big ugly thing in front of me showed just that. Greatest soldier smashed under a foot\u2026and hey, guess where I am.   Look, I got it. I\u2019m probably toast, like, will I make it? Probably not. But some beast is gonna keep smashing everything around us. Yeah, like that\u2019s not fun at all. Anyway, standing here\u2026I guess that\u2019s something I should try.
