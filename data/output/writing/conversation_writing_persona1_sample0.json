    "Original Sample": "Oh! My bad... They both exclaimed. Their fingers touched as they each extended a hand towards the wall. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 John was having a really bad day. His head absolutely ached like crazy. He showered, dressed, called his Uber, headed down, then slipped on a teeny tiny pool of water in the kitchen. Like 5ish years ago, he began living without a caretaker. Sure, he was blind but he wasn't dumb. It took him, like, a good year or so to get used to it but y'know it was worth it for the solitude or whatever. He worked at a sports retail company as some accountant or something. Pretty boring, honestly, but he was glad he made some bank. So he remembered, like, when he slid an ice cube under the fridge last night or at least tried doing it. His aim was usually cool, but he guessed last night his feet couldn\u2019t tell how far from the fridge they were. He got up and did breakfast. Toast, butter jam \u2013 fave of the day, but ran out of the jam. So cinnamon toast it is! He finished up, started cleaning and then boom, a text from the Uber driver. He got to work and bam - right to the boss' office. Sat down. Formal greetings. Heard paper slide across the desk. Downsizing. Didn't make the cut. He left. He also bought a plane ticket to Los Angeles... for funsies. Wanted a way out of there. Knew solo living with no job would be hell, so vacation time! Why not SoCal? Always wanted to put his hands where Clark Gable did! An Uber again, ride to airport. There, sudden bathroom urge hit him. Didn't know where it was, so duh, asked a seer. Walked as directed. Didn't didn't notice other footsteps. Both reached for wall. Bam. Fingers touched. Suddenly, John's day wasn't bad anymore. Wait there's more! He suddenly found himself soaring into the clouds, on a flight full of unexpected emotions... But that's a story for another day! Cheers, your fav writer \ud83d\ude09\u2728",

        "User: I don't like that suggestion because it completely changes the tone. Let's keep it an exclamation, but make it more formal. What about just saying: 'My apologies'?",
