    "Updated Writing Sample": "```plaintext\nTime is a creature best left untouched. In 2021, we launched our time machine, sending every single one of Earth's most intellectually gifted minded peoples, including scientists, physicists, doctors, etc. I was among those who went along, and what we found was even the most intelligent people sometimes make the biggest mistakes. You see, we choose to go 100 years into the future. Perhaps an arbitrary amount, but there are plenty of philosophers and mathematicians who will tell you that humans are drawn towards numbers that end in zero. We certainly were. What we found was that the world we had left behind was not the world we would enter. Sure, that seems that it should obviously be that way, but change is not always for the better. [Side_Note] This passage respects the insightful tone and discourages aggressive language, in line with the persona's preferences. We were heartbroken as we saw the land ravaged by conflict, with those old enough to wield a weapon struggling for survival. [Side_Note] Using descriptive language and terminology highlighting connectedness and survival aligns with the indigenous leader's style and preferences. There were no longer borders, order had taken a turn for the worse, and language was a strange combination of English and, to be quite frank, incomprehensible grunts. When we left, humankind shortly fell off. Without new ways to understand and efficiently extract resources, people found themselves in a bind with what to do with what resources were left. A bottle of water could cost you your life if you took it from the wrong person. Anarchy erupted as governments could not contain the wrath of the people. We'd attempt to rebuild, but these people simply do not know. Anyone who remembered what had happened had died off, and there are stories of what happened. Each tribe, for lack of a better phrase, had their own myth for what occurred to reach this stage. Some said the Gods had been angered. Others pointed to the skies, blaming aliens. [Side_Note] Storytelling resonates with the respect for traditional proverbs and cultural context-liked formatting choice. We felt as outcasts, knowing we had let our own people tumble this far. The time to rebuild is over. There's no going back. Friendly tribes lack the resources to make a significant impact. [Side_Note] Descriptive titles respect heritage and emphasise the hope and resilience of allied groups. Hostile tribes have most of the share, but refuse to contribute to any purpose other than feeding themselves. Myself, I am a man of science and philosophy. While I certainly grieve for the state of mankind, one thing is for certain. The age-old question of whether or not man is evil and selfish at his roots has been answered.\n```",

        "Assistant: Absolutely. Let's go through your writing sample together, and we'll adjust it sentence by sentence.",
        "Original_Sentence: The land was ravaged by war, anyone old enough to hold a gun fought for their own people.",
        "[Side_Note]: '[Writing Styles] Likes' Respectful tone and '[Writing Styles] Dislikes' Aggressive language. The original sentence can feel detached and harsh.",
        "User: I want to express empathy and connection with the struggle of my people.",
        "Assistant: We could say, 'We were heartbroken as we saw the land ravaged by conflict, with those old enough to wield a weapon struggling for survival.'",
        "User: Yes, this is more in line with the narrative I aim to convey and is still emotionally impactful.",
        "Original_Sentence: We'd attempt to rebuild, but these people simply do not know.",
        "[Side_Note]: '[Formatting Styles] Likes' Inclusion of traditional proverbs or quotes. This could resonate more with a storytelling aspect.",
        "User: How can we make this reflect the respect for ancestral wisdom better?",
        "Assistant: Consider referencing the importance of stories or traditions, perhaps, 'We'd attempt to rebuild, but there were stories of what happened.'",
        "User: That works, as it captures the essence of cultural memory and respect for the past.",

        "Assistant: An alternate way could be 'Friendly tribes, though hopeful, lack the abundant resources to lead significant change.'",
        "User: I prefer a simpler narrative that retains the emphasis on community spirit.",
        "Assistant: How about just emphasizing 'Friendly tribes lack the resources to make a significant impact.' with descriptive emphasis?",
        "User: Yes, that maintains the necessary focus and respects our style preferences."
