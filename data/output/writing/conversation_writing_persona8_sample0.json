    "Updated Writing Sample": "[Side_Note] Adding creative expression and inventive vocabulary: It transpired with the swiftness of a shadow fleeing the sun.  \nI had been strolling with the beast on a leash.  \nOur neighborhood was always cluttered but had never quivered with menace.  \nA plethora of renters at varying quality meant some overgrown grass, garbage that had never been taken to the street, and kid's toys left to bleach in the sun.  \nNever peril, never peril until oblivion clinched its icy grip.  \nI heard the shriek of tires crying out in anguish behind me.  \nTurning around there was a silver sedan.  \nI recognized the chariot of speed.  \nIt was driven by a student at the university.  \nWe thought he might deal in the shadows, but his face was unknown.  \nHe was carving a path around the curve, an arc too reckless for his own fate.  \nTerry, my girlfriend's bulldog, seemed insouciant by the cacophony.  \nHis attention was irrevocably claimed by a scattering of golden spuds on the opposite trod.  \nWhy had we ventured onto the open path?  \nI sprang from danger's embrace and onto the verdant sanctuary.  \nTerry lingered in peril's path.  \nI yanked at his tether in a furor, aware the vehicle was moments from rending him.  \nWith sinews strained, I wrenched, extracting him from fate's jaws.  \nI toppled, foredoomed, toward the unforgiving route, feeling the machine's cruel breath, then a vast nothingness.  \n\u201cThis is dire indeed...\u201d a soft, tremulous utterance floated above.  \nI felt untethered.  \nMy eyes remained gates to the visionless realm, yet elation swathed me.  \nShould air possess a thread count, this air was of the finest weave.  \n\u201cWhat calamity unfolds?\u201d quoth I.  \nInstantly, revelation struck as if long known.  \nUpon granting sight, a panorama of gilded hues, dusk's embrace and purity enwrapped me.  \nAn overwhelming sense of peace smothered the crushing reality of doom beneath steel limbs.  \nAn ancient presence awaited me. His visage, though ageless, bore the chronicles of epochs, with burdens etched deep.  \n\u201cYou are unscheduled for this realm,\u201d the equivocal presence mused, rifling through a tome of countless tales.  \nBefore words found me, a newsy lad, brimming with the naivet\u00e9 of another age, appeared with dispatch in hand.  \nThe figure scanned it rapidly, \u201cAccompany me,\u201d he beckoned.  \nYet, I was anchored, drawn by invisible tethers.  \nThrough nebulous clouds I soared, across towering peaks of unfathomable hues and boundless fields where time's favoured children cavorted.  \nI ascended past realms aglow, through extremities of warmth and chill unimagined.  \nThe radiance intensified, cocooning me in brilliance.  \nContours and constructs encircled me, yet shadows found no birth.  \n\u201cStep forth, scion of life,\u201d intoned a celestial voice.  \nIts dialect struck me as foreign, yet intimately divine I knew.  \nI prostrated before palpable divinity.  \n\u201cI requested advance, not adulation, ye fervent pleaser,\u201d retorted the voice, its cadence now unmistakably Godly.  \nThe light receded, unveiling a dominion thrumming with luminescent symphonies.  \nPerched upon a sovereign chair of universal majesty sat the Omniscient.  \nWith reverence entwined with dread, I glanced upward.  \n\u201cYour visage disappoints, I perceive,\u201d said the wizened figure, \u201cMany of pale descent share your surprise. Crafted all are, in the image of their multitudes.\u201d  \nThe accent's familiarity clicked.  \n\u201cIt is... indeed an honor, my\u2014\u201d  \n\u201cDispense of empty etiquette. Attend now, offspring of the earth,\u201d declared the Eternal, oblivious to the barb against my mourning mother, \u201cA grievous err has manifested.\u201d  \n\u201cWhat deed have I embarked upon to cause this?\u201d  \n\u201cThat beast was decreed by fate's design to be struck thus,\u201d proclaimed the Creator.  \n\u201cI... cannot fathom...\u201d  \n\u201cCryptic my ways may be. Listen well. A reprieve you receive. Yet, the creature must meet destiny's end, and she must part from you. Thus it shall prevent calamity.\u201d  \n\u201cWhat riddles guard your logic? What is my utterance to be?\u201d  \nTempest within the chamber swelled, and His voice, once Calm Elderly, thundered, \u201cSay it was decreed by divine provenance. Falter not, indolent mortal.\u201d  \nI regained consciousness upon verdant ground.  \nThe blare of aid was a discord piercing my skull.  \nAbove, authored by fright and reeking of the haze, the vehicle's young helmsman was confined by law.  \nTo my reverent awe, Terry licked my renewal. I was among realms of the living.  \nUncanny stillness assessed my injury, but mortality gripped firmly.  \nAn utterance or groan of mine transpired.  \nAn officer loomed, the mirror of the divine gaze above.  \nA congenial curve of lips; a conspiratorial wink from Him, and then a call to tend me, sprang forth.  \n(First scroll presented. Forgive the rust-born creaks. Hoping it shimmers more than dims.)  \nEDIT: Orthography/Grammar",

    "Original Sample": "It happened so fast. I had been walking the dog. Our neighborhood was always dirty, but never unsafe. A plethora of renters at varying quality meant some overgrown grass, garbage that had never been taken to the street, and kid's toys left to bleach in the sun. Never danger, never danger until it was too late. I heard the sound of tires screeching behind me. Turning around there was a silver sedan. I knew the car. It was driven by a student at the university. We thought he might deal drugs, but we did n't know him. He was peeling around the curve, far too fast for his own good.   Terry, my girlfriend's bulldog, seemed unphased by the sound. His attention was firmly on a smattering of french fries on the sidewalk across the way. Why did we walk in the street? I leapt out of the way and onto the grass. Terry remained on the road. I yanked at his leash in a frenzy, knowing the car was about to strike him. With all my strength I tugged, pulling him out of harm's way. I lost my balance, fell toward the road, I felt the pressure of the car, then nothing.   \u201c This is bad... \u201d a timid, high voice spoke somewhere about me. I felt light. I had n't opened my eyes yet, but I was happy. If air could have a thread count, this air had a high one.   \u201c What is bad? \u201d I said. I knew immediately where I was. Opening my eyes I witnessed a splendor of gold, sunset and white all around me. A prevailing sense of ease had replaced the pressure of the car over top of me. The reality of my death was never able to settle on me, so great was my euphoria. Before me stood a man. He did n't appear old, but his eyes said that he had been here for a thousand years, and the bags showed they had not all been pleasant years.   \u201c You are n't scheduled to be here yet. \u201d The timid man scoured through a large book with thousands of dog eared pages. Before I could answer, a young newsy looking boy burst through a door I had n't seen to hand the man a note. The man quickly read over the note, \u201c Come with me,  he said.   I was n't able to come, though. All at once I felt pulled. I was pulled though clouds, and through whole mountains pained exotic colors I'd never seen, and across fields where all the grandparents and presidents and kings of all the ages played in a youthful daze. I was pulled up and up through spheres of lights and extremes of temperatures. I was pulled up until the light around me was a brilliant white. There were walls and objects around me, but nothing cast any shadows.   \u201c Step forward, my child. \u201d Said a voice. It had an accent that struck me as odd, but I knew it at once to be God. I fell to my knees in awe.   \u201c I said step forward, not grovel, you brown noser. \u201d The accent was stronger this time, and threw me off guard. The light faded, and I saw his mighty throne room made not with gold or silver but with tendrils of light and music. Upon a seat that glittered with the majesty of creation sat God. Trembling with fear, I looked up.   \u201c You look disappointed, \u201d said the elderly looking Asian man sitting in front of me,  \u201c Most white people are. I made people in my image. Most people are Asian. Do n't look so surprised. \u201d I knew that accent sounded strange.   \u201c It's... uh... it's an honor, my\u2014 \u201d   \u201c I do n't have time for your formalities. Listen here, you son of a bitch, \u201d The lord said, not realizing how profound of an insult this was to my probably grieving mother, \u201c You screwed up, you really screwed up. \u201d   \u201c What did I do? \u201d   \u201c That car was supposed to hit that dog. \u201d Said the lord.   \u201c I'm -- -I'm not sure I understand. \u201d   \u201c I work in mysterious ways. Listen. I'm going to give you one more chance. You have to kill that dog, and your girlfriend has to leave you. Otherwise there will be a bad war. \u201d   \u201c What? That does n't make any sense? What am I supposed to say? \u201d   The wind in the room picked up, and God's elderly Chinese voice became a terrifying boom, \u201c Tell them God told you to do it. Do n't fail me you lazy ass. \u201d   I woke up in someone's yard. The sound of an ambulance was like a knife to my head. Above me I saw the terrified and stoned driver of the car being handcuffed by a police officer. To my left, Terry was licking my face. I was alive. I did n't know how bad my injuries were, but I was certainly alive. I must have made some noise. The police officer above me looked down. Immediately I realized his face to be that of God. He smiled, winked, and then looked up to alert the paramedics that I appeared to be alive.   ( First time submitting. Very rusty. Sorry if this sucks. )   EDIT : Spelling/Grammar"
