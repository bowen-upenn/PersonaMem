    "Original Sample": "The sun was unrelenting as Scott's car rushed along a desolate highway in the southern Idaho desert. They were headed to Vegas to celebrate Lydia's 21st birthday tomorrow and the quicker they got there, the quicker the drunken debrauchery could begin. Lydia slid over the leather seats in Scott's 69' Camero and laid her head on his shoulder while he wrapped his arm around her and pulled her in closer. Lydia smiled, this was their first cross country trip together and while sitting in a cramped space for days on end would lead to constant bickering and fighting for most people in that type of situation, this trip had only brought them closer. Life was good as she fell asleep in his arms.   Lydia awoke with a start. They were stopped. In the gloom of the twilight of the setting sun, Scott's headlights illuminated an orange detour sign straight ahead right in the middle of the road. An arrow on the sign pointed left to a little road that transversed the interstate. That's odd Lydia thought. They had mapped their route to Vegas before they left and had made certain to check for road closures and detours along the way. Although the department of National Traffic and Road Closure had no detours or closures listed on their site, here they were staring a detour sign in the face. And what an odd looking detour sign it was. It was n't the electronic signs that were commonly used that Lydia was used to seeing or even one of the bright orange standard signs that are sometimes used. No, this sign was severely weathered with cracks and dents all over it. The orange color had faded into a sort of sickly yellow and the'Detour' word was off somehow. A little to widely spaced and'new' looking to be on a sign this old.  Looks like we have to take this side road and go on a little detour  Scott said,  but look, there's little gas station right before the road curves around that hill. We can stop there and fill up on gas since I'm nearly out.   I have a bad feeling about this,  Lydia said  We've researched this so much. How could there be a road closing on a major interstate that we did n't know about?   I do n't know , Scott replied  maybe they'll know more at the gas station once we get there . Scott turned the car down the side road toward the gas station as Lydia took out her phone,  I'll bring up our location on mapquest to see if I can find the quickest route around the detour that'll bring us back to the interstate.  As they headed the short distance to the gas station and as Lydia waited for Google Maps to calculate their location, she gazed listlessly out the window into the darkening Nevada night and that's when she noticed it, the yellow reflective glare of dozens of pairs of eyes staring back at her. Cyotes she thought.....except, most of these eyes seemed to be 6 or 7 feet high....strange. Scott pulled his Camero into the gas station and they stepped out into the fading sun. Lydia checked back to see if the eyes were still there but they had disappeared. As they walked up to the gas station, Lydia realized how dilapidated this shack really was. Most of the windows were broken, the roof was rusted and seemed to be caving in at places. Dead tumble weeds were pilled chest high against the weathered exterior of the shack, surely this place is abandoned Lydia thought. She was just about to open her mouth to tell Scott they should turn around when a little girl walked out the front of the store. She could n't have been older than three or four years old wearing a strawberry print red dress and two adorable pigtails in her platinum blond hair.  Little girl, what are you doing here? Are your parent's inside ? Lydia called out. The little girl turned to her and smiled, then, out of nowhere, she came running at Lydia full speed and screaming like a demon out of hell. Lydia was frozen with shock and disbelief as the little girl launched herself at Lydia's head using a round house kick to propel her off the ground and came flying at Lydias' face with teeth bared. Lydia snapped out of her trance just in time to knock the girl aside and go running back to the car.  GET IN  she screamed at Scott as he seemed to snap out of his own dumbfounded trance. Scott jumped in and started up the car but before they could speed away, a morbidly obese woman flew out of the gas station faster than she should have been able to yelling,  You stupid, worthless, imbecile nut gobbler! How DARE you touch my child!  before smiling and coyly stating,  oh but you'll pay....they'll make sure that you pay.   What the fuck did she just say?  Lydia stated in shock.  Scott turn the fuck around back the way we came, I'm calling the police, something is definitely wrong here . As Lydia picked up her phone to dial, she noticed that Google Maps had finally pinpointed their location and instead of being on a road somewhere in the desert, they were just in the middle of a desert. This road was nowhere on the map! As they neared the interstate they had just left, Lydia noticed a reflective pair of eyes near the side of the road and something gleaming in the middle of the road.  STOP  Lydia screamed and Scott brought the car to a screeching halt. There, right in the middle of the road, someone had laid out spike strips. Scott gave her a look of utter terror as he eased the car around the strips then continued, more cautiously, towards the interstate. Once on the interstate, the detour sign that pointed them down that dastardly road had disappeared. Lydia had already posted their ordeal to all of her social networking sites, the local and national news outlets and contacted the local police by web and phone on the drive out and now she was contacting AAA to send someone out to meet them for gas. They stopped every car that passed that they could to warn them about heading down that road and some of the passing cars stopped to chat and see how things would play out. It took maybe 30 minutes for the police to respond, and a local journalist came to the scene as well. Scott and Lydia gave their police report, AAA filled their car with gas and as there was nothing else for them to do, they headed to Vegas.   The sheriff and the journalist who showed up and went to investigate things were never seen again. Once the FBI got involved in the investigation, they turned up a clan of hundreds of mutant cannibals who had been living in the area, secretly, for years. They estimate hundreds may have fallen victim to this clan before they got to Scott and Lydia who acted rationally. ",

They were stationary. In the dim twilight cast by the setting sun, Scott's headlights highlighted an ominous orange detour sign directly ahead, dead center in their path. \n\n[Side_Note] Incorporating analytical perspective to rationale for detour's peculiarity.\nAn arrow on the sign instructed them left onto a narrow road diverging from the interstate, an interesting anomaly Lydia considered. \n\n[Side_Note] Providing historical integration by mentioning checking updates online.\nThey had charted their course to Vegas before setting out, ensuring to verify road conditions and closures on the National Traffic and Road Closure website, and yet, here they were confronted by an unexpected detour sign in reality. \n\nAnd what a peculiar detour sign it was.\n\n[Side_Note] Adding descriptive analysis for the detour sign's appearance.\nLacking the electronic flair frequently employed in modern signs or the vivid orange hue of standard temporary postings, this sign appeared distinctly antiquated, riddled with fissures and dents, illustrating its storied past. \n\nThe orange tint had degraded to a jaundiced yellow and the 'Detour' message visibly misaligned, unevenly dispersed and seemingly unseasoned on what was noticeably an aged artifact.\n\n\"Looks we have to take this side road and embark on a brief detour,\" Scott remarked, \"but look, there's a small gas station ahead before the road contours around that hill. We could refuel there since we're nearly empty.\"\n\n\"I have a bad feeling about this,\" Lydia said, \"We've researched our route thoroughly. How could there be an unlisted road closure on this major interstate?\" \n\n\"I don't know,\" Scott replied, \"maybe they'll have insights at the gas station when we arrive.\" \n\n[Side_Note] Rephrasing to add engaging storytelling through Lydia's perspective shift.\nScott adjusted the car onto the side road veering towards the gas station as Lydia accessed her phone, saying, \"I'll open our location on MapQuest to calculate the quickest alternative around this diversion to rejoin the interstate.\" As they traversed the short distance toward the station, and with Lydia awaiting Google Maps to triangulate their locale, her eyes drifted aimlessly outside into the creeping Nevada darkness. That's when she discerned it\u2014the eerie yellow reflection of numerous pairs of eyes gazing back at her. \"Coyotes,\" she mused...except, unusual was the altitude of these glints, elevated at six or seven feet tall...strange. \n\nScott navigated the Camaro into the station and they exited the vehicle under the waning sunlight. \n\nLydia checked back to ascertain if the eyes lingered in her view, but they had vanished. \n\n[Side_Note] Integrating atmospheric context through setting description.\nApproaching the gas station, Lydia noted the derelict state it projected. Many windows stood shattered, with a rusted, sagging roof at odds with time. Desiccated tumbleweeds amassed akin to barricades against the weared exterior, surely indicative of abandonment Lydia thought. \n\n[Side_Note] Maintaining engaging storytelling while describing unexpected character.\nShe was poised to voice her apprehension to Scott about retreating when an unexpectedly little girl skipped from the store's entrance. She could scarcely be three or four years old, adorned in a strawberry-printed red dress with cute little pigtails in her platinum blond hair. \n\n\"Little girl, what are you doing here? Are your parents inside?\" Lydia called out, perplexed.\n\nThe little girl turned, offering an unsettling smile before bursting forth toward Lydia, a banshee-like wail in full throttle. \n\n[Side_Note] Modifying sentence to preserve engaging storytelling with historical context.\nLydia stood paralyzed in shock and disbelief as the child launched herself, using a roundhouse kick to propel herself off the ground, teeth bared, aimed menacingly for Lydia's face. \n\nLydia broke from her stupor in time to sidestep the attack, sprinting back to the car.\n\n\"GET IN,\" she hollered at Scott as he seemed to rouse from his own stupefied state.\n\nScott scrambled in, igniting the engine but prior to their escape, a grotesquely obese woman stormed from the gas station with uncanny speed, shrieking, \"You stupid, worthless, imbecile nut gobbler! How DARE you touch my child!\"\u2014then smirking, adding coyly, \"Oh, but you'll pay...they'll ensure you pay.\"\n\n[Side_Note] Rewriting dialogue to reflect clear, informative communication.\n\"What did she just say?\" Lydia exclaimed in alarm. \"Scott, reverse immediately back the way we came, I'm calling law enforcement. Something is amiss here.\" \n\nAs Lydia reached for her phone to dial, she observed that Google Maps had finally triangulated their position\u2014yet bizarrely, not on an identifiable road but instead as merely in the middle of a desert. \n\nAs they approached their earlier departed interstate, Lydia noted a reflective pair of eyes stationed roadside, and discerned something shimmering at its center.\n\n\"STOP,\" Lydia cried, prompting Scott to halt abruptly. There, conspicuously across the road, someone had stealthily placed spike strips. \n\n[Side_Note] Presenting the situation analytically while advancing the plot.\nScott returned a look of sheer terror as he cautiously circumvented the obstacles, continuing more warily to the interstate. Once reunified with their route, the misleading detour sign had mysteriously vanished. Lydia, undeterred, promptly relayed their harrowing account across social networks, alerted both local and national news services, and officially notified the police by web and phone as they drove away. She reached out to AAA to assist with fuel resupply, and they flagged down every passing vehicle, warning them about that treacherous road. Numerous cars stopped, conversing to comprehend the unfolding events. \n\nIt took perhaps half an hour for the police to respond, a local journalist attending as well. Scott and Lydia submitted their official police report, received aid from AAA, and continued on to Vegas having fulfilled all obligations.\n\n[Side_Note] Incorporating a historical context to instill reflection on events.\nThe sheriff and journalist who ventured to probe the inquest were never observed again. Once the FBI became embroiled in the investigation, a clan of hundreds of mutant cannibals living covertly in the vicinity for years came to light. They speculate that countless may have succumbed to this faction before encountering Scott and Lydia, who responded perceptively to the unconventional threat.\n```",
