    "Original Sample": " You've got to be kidding me!    Bruce knelt down and lifted the scrawny pile of purple, as Don Falcon's crew drew near. He started running down the alleyway when a black Rolls Royce turns into the opening.    Dammit!  Bruce cursed through his teeth.  Too late.   The doors on the Royce burst open as three, rather rotund, gangster piled out, hefting sawed-off shotguns in Bruce's direction.   Looking up, Bruce noticed a fire escape a few yards away. Running in that direction he heard the first blast from the sawed-off. It pinged off a dumpster in the alley as Bruce ran past. Arriving at the base of the fire escape, Bruce tossed the Joker up to the first level, a task almost too easy for the masked mountain of muscle. As Bruce rose to pick up his nemesis, a shot rang off the fire escape, this time is found its mark in Bruce's shoulder.   With a cry of pain Bruce grasped his shoulder, wondering whether or not saving his archenemy was worth the trouble. He looked down at the purple garbed snake and thought it best to continue the rescue.   Lifting the Joker again, Bruce ran up the fire escape, and to the rooftop.   By this time someone had called the cops, there were choppers in the air and sirens screaming their way through Gotham to Bruce's location. Bruce ran to the north end of the rooftop, to where the Batmobile was parked. As he was running, the gangsters reached the rooftop, guns blazing in the Batman's direction.   Reaching the roofs edge, Bruce jumped over the edge, turning quickly in the air and firing his grappling gun at the roofs edge, at the same time preparing for the jolting halt of his fall. He reached the ground and ran to the Batmobile, threw the Joker into the passenger seat and sped off into the night.   ***   Opening his eyes warily, the Joker rose from where he had been laying. Looking around, he noticed nothing. He did not have ay idea where he was. All he new was it was dark and damp.   Lights started coming on, as a door opened in the wall. The Batman walked in, right up to the bars on the Jokers cage.    Why so serious?  Batman said, smiling. ",
