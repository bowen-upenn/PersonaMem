    "Original Sample": " Hello! Welcome to the National Association for Unorthodox Delivery ( NUOD )! We're glad that you've chosen us to help put your body through the paces! With our patented eight step process, you'll have a brand new child in record time, guaranteed!     Step One : Find a mate.     Surprised? Through careful research, it's been discovered that to effectively spawn a child using your own womb, a second member has to be involved in the process, preferable with the opposite genitalia that you have! Look for people with qualities that you want in your baby, like strength, stamina, and attractiveness!     Step Two : Convince the mate.     Due to archaic laws regarding child care, babies spawned from wombs are financially attached to both members of what we will now refer to as  The Birthing Crew . It is your job to convince your other Crew member that this is an opportunity for them, regardless of their personal feelings on the matter. If you succeed, proceed to Step Four!     Step Three : Kidnap the mate.     If your fellow Crew member is unwilling to help you spawn your child, that's alright! You were destined for motherhood ; nothing will stand in your way! There are many different ways to kidnap someone, but the tried and true methods are listed in the separate article'Force and Fear : How to make sure things go your way!'     Step Four : Have sex.     Now that you've secured your fellow Crew member, it's time for you two to get to work! No need to set the mood ; regardless of whether your Crew member is cooperating, you are in charge here! Simply connect your respective genitalia in the proper way and let the magic happen! For more information, see our separate article'How to Copulate : A comprehensive study'    Step Five :???.     -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Data Corrupted -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --     Step Six : Profit.     Step Seven : Assess Legal Situation.     During the course of your birthing cycle, you and you Birthing Crew may have come across immoral or unethical situations. That's alright! Here at the NUOD, our staff and legal team have years of experience dealing with these types of cases. Please contact our team at [ unavailable ] for further inquiries.     Step Eight : Birth your child.     During your carrying period, you might have felt stirrings inside your womb, as the baby grows. As you get closer to delivery, these stirring will become stronger. That is simply the baby trying to fight its way out of your womb! This part of the process is the easiest, as the child will do most of the work for you as it pushes its way to freedom. Simply relax, lean back and let it do the rest.     If you have complete all these steps, then the efforts of your Birthing Crew will have succeeded in creating a healthy, attractive, muscular child for you to do with as you please! Congratulations!

    "Updated Writing Sample": "[Side_Note: The original enthusiastic tone is toned down to match the author's dry wit and critical viewpoint likes.] Hello. Welcome to the National Association for Unorthodox Delivery (NUOD). We understand you've reluctantly selected us for your unconventional adventure.\n\n[Side_Note: The original humorous tone fine-tuned with a sarcastic touch.] Step One: Find a mate with traits you deem useful, like brute strength or the right kind of face.\n\n[Side_Note: Added sarcasm as per persona\u2019s liking for sarcastic tone.] Preferably, someone of the opposite sex; you're bound by nature's impractical rules.\n\n[Side_Note: Added a side note format the persona likes.] Step Two: Convince the mate.\n\n[Side_Note: Sarcastic tone and quick subpoints without too many deviations keeps in line with likes for succinct subsections and sarcastic humor.] Yes, archaic laws state that offspring are a joint financial burden. Think of it as an investment opportunity, regardless of their sentiments.\n\nStep Three: Kidnap the mate.\n\n[Side_Note: A formal, straightforward reference within keeping it short goes with author's informal language and succinct bullet-style points.] If unwilling, don't fret. Your journey to motherhood isn't derailed just yet. Consult 'Force and Fear: How to ensure things go as planned.'\n\nStep Four: Have sex.\n\n[Side_Note: Sarcastic, direct delivery without unnecessary embellishments matches the persona.] Skip the unnecessary frills. Take charge because, in this partnership, you\u2019re clearly the CEO.\n\nStep Five: ???.\n\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Data Corrupted -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nStep Six: Profit.\n\nStep Seven: Assess Legal Situation.\n\n[Side_Note: Adding straightforward practical descriptor for legal aid aligns with cynical humor spectrum.] Inevitably, legal grey areas may have occurred. Don\u2019t worry, specialists at the NUOD have maneuvered around stickier situations.\n\nStep Eight: Birth your child.\n\nCongratulations on navigating this eight-step gauntlet of surreal delivery! If it appears you\u2019ve achieved what we hesitantly dub \"success,\" a generic, hopefully robust human should pop out eventually.",
