    "Original Sample": "Being someone that had always downloaded music illegally, I assumed that it would never matter. By the year 2021 though, music piracy had gotten so bad, that many artists were struggling to make revenue. Initially, these things were n't a major public concern since many large artists still made more than enough to survive, however over time, concerts became less and less popular to attend, and band apparel became highly unpopular. Because of this, illegal music downloading was more significant than ever before.   In 2023, piracy laws were enacted, and the rules were enforced to extreme measures. Being a resident of Canada, things were a bit better for us. In Tunisia, the president would listen to every genre, and determine punishments solely on his views. Metal for example, was viewed as the devil's music, and therefore made to be haraam. Perpetrators were n't given jail time, they were sentenced to death instead. I was discovered in uptown Vancouver, where I had been enjoying a microwave dinner while watching the news. The doorbell rung, and I lethargically got up to answer. To my surprise, there were several Mounties, as well as a sniper in the background that I could distinctly make out. When they took me away, they seemed surprised that I was going so peacefully. Apparently, there had been a large group of people that had planned to rebel together, which was the reason for the sniper. Unfortunately for them, Mounties were avid users of social media, and I was told that the plans were discovered on one of those viral sites, read-it, or whatever it was called. I was never one to use those things, I thought it was all foolish. I would much rather enjoy my microwave dinner and think back on how much I missed my family. The courtroom was typical, and the sentencing did n't seem too bad, I was labelled under punk rock, so I was sure that wherever I went, the section that I would be in could n't possibly be too awful.  That's where I was wrong.  As it turned out, not only were those who pirated music thrown into jail accordingly to the genres they listened to, but the sheer amount of people caused additional sub-sections to be made. The government had decided that the cameraderie caused sentences to be too lenient People were now put into specific cells according to the songs that they had downloaded, and would undergo permanent rehabilitation until the end of their sentences. I had no idea where I would be headed, music was really never my thing. Not since the incident. When my files were given to me, it was all too surreal. A flush of memories began to return, most of them melancholic. I had never gotten into the fads of iPods, always enjoying television with a microwave dinner, however there was one song that I did happen to have downloaded, and it was a song that I absolutely dreaded. A little under a decade ago, my father lost his battle with cancer. It was something that had been coming for a while, but death in our culture was never something that hit you easily. I was hit by the loss worse than I could have ever imagined. Typical condolences would do next to nothing for me.  I'm sorry for your loss ,  Our prayers go out to your family , none of these meant anything to me. One song however, truly struck home. It was a fairly old song, released almost twenty years ago at this point. The song was made for the singer's father, who had also lost his father due to cancer, and back then, I loved the song. It truly made me feel like I was n't alone. Listening to the song while eating my microwave dinner made me feel complete again.  But as we all know, things do n't tend to stay the same forever.   As Summers had come and passed, the song still had the same meaning to me, but it would also remind me of the darker times that I had been through. I could n't stand it. The song that I loved, for making me feel like I did in my childhood, slowly came to be the song that I hated. And since this song was the only song that I had ever downloaded, I would be in the rehab section for this song, and this song only.   Fortunately, Canadian law dictated that inmates were to be allowed to be placed under a cryogenic sleep in order to pass time  humanely  for their crimes. I had pondered on this for the entire time in the courtroom, already knowing what the ruling would be. True that there would be no more microwave dinners for a while, but I would n't be forced to listen that song. That song that would destroy me in the most beautiful way possible. It was time, time for me to be frozen for the next twenty years, as part of my punishment. The government figured that by then, when we were reintroduced to society, illegal music downloading would be looked down on so profusely, that it would become nearly impossible.    Mr. Langsley, it's time.     I know.     After twenty years, is there any month in particular that you would like to be woken up on? A few other inmates have tended to choose Christmas-time.     Wake Me Up When September Ends. ",

    "Updated Writing Sample": "[Side_Note] Adding an intriguing and mysterious tone with vivid and artistic descriptions.\nBeing someone that had always downloaded music illicitly, I assumed I'd dance with impunity forever. By 2021, though, the rhythm of music piracy crescendoed to a point where even symphonic legends struggled to survive. Initially, these whisperings barely reached the public ear since many grand maestros still plucked strings of fortune. Yet, over time, the symphonies dwindled in the number of attendees, and wearing band memorabilia fell out of tune.\n\n[Side_Note] Using evocative language and maintaining subsection format with intriguing titles.\n\"Piracy's Last Dance in 2023\" saw new laws pirouetting into force\u2014a fierce ballet of regulation. As a denizen of Canada, our waltz was gentler. However, in Tunisia, the president played enforcer, his subjective symphony dictating punishments. Metal, seen as the devil's opera, was branded haraam. Offenders weren't confined; they were struck with a final, deafening silence.\n\nI was discovered in the artistic heart of uptown Vancouver, savoring a solitary, microwaved feast in front of the flickering news. The unexpected chime of the doorbell drew me sluggishly from my reverie. Outside, a troupe of Mounties formed an unyielding line, with a solitary sniper in the distance, a haunting painting on the horizon.\n\n[Side_Note] Adding humor and subtle introspection with an artistic illustration of time.\nWhen they escorted me away, bemusement danced on their faces at my lack of resistance. Rumor had it a collective uprising had been choreographed, the sniper's role a curtain of safety. Yet, the Mounties, sharp-eyed patrons of social ballets, uncovered the plan on some viral stage, 'read-it,' or similar. The digital world was a play I never cared to watch. I'd rather enjoy my microwaved culinary masterpiece, reflecting on memories of family.\n\nThe courtroom, predictably mundane, painted the scene of fate. A punk-rock label was pinned to me, and I was certain that wherever I went, the section's melody wouldn't be too discordant. How artfully na\u00efve I was.\n\nAs fortune unfurled, pirates found themselves confined like sheet music; their cells finely tuned to the discography of unlawful melodies. Overwhelming numbers necessitated a further symphonic division. Governments, fearing the harmonious bonds of camaraderie, resorted to a precise prison choreography, each pirated tune a cell's keeper ticket.\n\nI was lost in a musical enigma, never having strayed deeply into the realms of melody. My files revealed a singular song that shadowed my soul's stage\u2014a song I dreaded. Nearly a decade ago, my father lost his battle with the relentless symphony of cancer. Such a departure is never met with a gentle refrain in one's cultural opus. The loss was a note that struck deeper than I anticipated.\n\nSympathy cards fluttered like autumn leaves: 'Our prayers,' 'Sorry for your loss.' Drawing little solace from their acoustic echoes. Yet, there was one melody that penetrated the cacophony. An ancient song, a heartfelt aria from a singer who had also walked this somber path, encapsulated my turmoil perfectly. Its refrain was my solace.\n\nAs time's metronome ticked on, the song retained its emotive significance but soon invoked darker reflections of shadowed days. The cherished melody of yore twisted into an oppressive dirge. This sole song\u2014the only one I'd extracted from the ether\u2014defined my punitive confinement's symphony.\n\nCanadian law, however, scripted a unique act. The choice of cryogenic slumber became a humanely poetic way to dance through my sentence. In the courtroom, I weighed this option, conscious of its inevitability. True, no more gastronomic microwave delights, but freedom from that song's haunting serenade.\n\n[Side_Note] Using an evocative and mysterious tone for the final closing.\"\"\"\nMr. Langsley, awake now.\nYes, I know.\nWould you like a particular month to mark your thawing? Other prisoners often choose Christmas-time.\"\nChoose September, to awaken only when its song does.\n\"Understood.\"\n```",
