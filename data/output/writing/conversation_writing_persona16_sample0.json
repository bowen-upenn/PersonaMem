    "Original Sample": "One time there was a world where everybody was really mean to each other. I was not uncommon for people to walk around punching people in the face, calling people names, and stealing from them. In fact, everybody got everything from stealing it from people.   Until one day, a man named Bill came down from the sky...   Bill landed in the middle of a street. He approached a man who was wearing a hat.  Hello sir  Bill said,  Wow I really like your hat, where did you get it? I would like to buy a similar one because I like it so much.     Go away you fart smeller!!!  Said the man.  You are not going to steal my hat!!!     Oh my I think you are mistaken  said Bill.  I like your hat very much but I do not want to steal it.     Eat my fist of fury!!  said the man as he punched Bill in the face.  This is my hat and you ca n't have it!!     Ow that really hurt!  said Bill.   The man then punched Bill in the face again, knocking him to the ground. He started going through Bill's pockets and took out a Snickers bar.    Hey that is my Snickers! And Snickers is my favorite snack! If you want a piece of it you can just ask me and I can share with you!  said Bill.    Shut up butthead!  said the man as he curb stomped Bills face into the pavement.   Bill later died from his injuries.   The End",
