    "Original Sample": " Did n't we just talk about the dark ages, instructor? , asked a young female-hominid form.   The instructor AI smiled warmly.  Indeed we did, little one. But there is not just one! Here, let me explain.  With that, she dimmed the ambiance of the room to an icy uncertainness. The young minds squirmed with discomfort, but this would serve to implant the message all the better.    This other dark age occurred during the early second millenium. As you all know, the first dark age consisted of ignorance, violence, and the suppression of scholarly work. This second age of darkness was one of the mind, dear children.    Confusion emanated from the classroom. The AI instructor soothed them with waves of warmth and reassurances.    Tell me, class. What is the prime driver of progress? , questioned the flickering woman. Hands shot up, as did psychic pings and flashing lights of interest. The entire class was involved. The instructor paced, searching for a choice. She pointed to a metallic being that vaguely resembled a feline.    Cooperative exploration!! , shouted the analogue. The instructor psychically patted the student on the head.    That is correct! When we invest our energies and interests into a worthy and peaceful cause, we achieve. Think ; our collective is constantly searching the cosmos and ourselves. We peer into the Laws and welcome other minds into our ranks with open arms. The journey is what drives peace and prosperity, young ones. Without direction, minds stagnate and become bitter.    A Truehuman tentatively raised their hand and quickly pulled it down. The AI beamed an inquiry asking if the student wished to ask their question in private, to which she answered no. The instructor continued.    This *other* dark age was, as I mentioned, of the mind. This was a new and interesting time ; the web of connectivity was first being spun. Thoughts and emotions could be shared between anything for the first time in our history. This influx of information and refinement took ahold of our forebears, who settled into complacency. They complained over the speeds with which they could connect to the Great Web ; they bitterly fought one another over differing ideals ; they abused its potential with primal urges. They became reclusive and angry.    The instructor paused, waiting for questions. One came anonymously ;  What was it like before the Great Web, madame?    The holographic instructor smiled and answered,  Well, imagine an island surrounded by water. Every mind was an island, unconnected with any other,  The professor emanated calm to the students in preparation for the coming words,  and all of the fears and pain and doubts felt by a mind was theirs alone to face. Any conceivable horror was faced completely alone, though frail connections were made in the form of friendships. But the pain a mind endured before the Connection was immense and, often, too much to bear.    The class swarmed with despair and a forlorn sense of admiration. The instructor decided to end the lesson for the day, to allow the children to return to the Great Web and to seek out their forebears. It would do them well to meet those that endured so much.",
