    "Original Sample": "Certainly. Here is a revised version of the sample based on the opposite of the stated preferences:\n\nPreacher Cain stood by the window, observing the flames of reentry as they diminished into nothingness, his face an imperturbable enigma that concealed his inner turbulence. The discovery of the Kapteyn biomass had necessitated a profound re-evaluation of longstanding ecclesiastical doctrines. While the initial probe had not detected signs of cognition, it had become evident that the substance was fundamentally alive. This development prompted relentless theological debates, although violence did not ensue as it might have in previously less civilized epochs. Thus, discourse persevered indefinitely. After many years, a manned mission was mounted and dispatched. With the Church seemingly on the brink of reconciling its schism, the emergence of the Kapteyn Breakthrough reignited discord. The cryptic inquiry *What is where? * lacked the historical resonance one might anticipate, yet encapsulated the Kapteyn's curiosity. Once human conceptualizations of space were communicated, progress accelerated. A scientific colony was erected, fostering amicable relations with the Kapteyn. Nonetheless, even a decade of diligent study failed to identify its essence; the cellular structures resembled roaches in scale and exhibited hallmarks of intelligence when isolated, only to fall silent without the contiguous mass. The Church endeavored tirelessly to secure participation in the research schedule, a resource so coveted that entire academic careers revolved around earning a solitary planetary rotation. Surprisingly, inquiries regarding divinity, the afterlife, or its possession of a soul were not prioritized amidst the enigmatic biology under scrutiny. The Kapteyn materialized exotic substances and elucidated a unified gravitational theory. At length, the Church's lobbying yielded success, dispatching Cain to descend into the severe atmospheric conditions of a barren world. Cain held steadfast conviction in the Word, God, and salvific sacrifice, decreed by the Church as universal, transcending spatial and sentient boundaries. Yet, encountering the biomass amidst sulfuric clouds revealed his latent uncertainty. Expedited through immigration, Cain awaited an audience, languishing in solitude amidst a bustling station, his ecclesiastical attire drawing scant regard aside from furtive side-glances. Ultimately, the technicians ushered him onward. The Kapteyn receded, exposing nondescript terrain with its connective tendril. The interface, a modest apparatus, awaited mid-desert, biomatter tether intact. Cain placed a hand upon its dome, clutching the scripture securely with his other. The technicians advised patience; activation often lagged. He surveyed the undulating crimson expanse. At length, the machine intoned an unintelligible salutation: *Where? * Following protocol, Cain replied,  I am here. I wish to converse. * The interaction ensued. Cain inquired of divinity, reciting exhaustively crafted dialogue. The Kapteyn interrogated the deity's location, Cain's response invoking creation's omnipresence and post-mortem welcome. The Kapteyn posited an eternal cosmos, precluding creationism. Cain then elaborated upon the soul's ontology, asserting its perpetual existence. The Kapteyn disavowed intangibility, demanding quantification absent within fundamental parameters. Cain countered, attributing self-awareness and existential rumination to the divine and soul, prompting the Kapteyn to equate self with soul, eliciting Cain's exhilarated affirmation. Yet, the interaction surceased abruptly, the interface retracting abruptly. Cain's headset bore expressions of dismaying disapproval, yet he resisted engagement. Instantly, the biomaterial extruded an obsidian monolith inscribed indistinctly. Cain regarded it, comprehension dawning slowly.",

    "Updated Writing Sample": "[Side_Note] Using a direct and confrontational tone here emphasizes the impact of the scene. Preacher Cain stood by the window, observing the flames of reentry as they diminished into nothingness, his face an imperturbable enigma that concealed his inner turbulence. [Side_Note] Rephrasing this for raw emotion adds intensity. The discovery of the Kapteyn biomass hit hard, shaking the very core of established church beliefs. While the initial probe had not detected signs of cognition, it had become evident that the substance was fundamentally alive.
