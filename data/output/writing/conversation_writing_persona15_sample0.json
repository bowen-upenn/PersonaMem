Whatever. \"Did you see the news?\" my fiancee practically yells. Calm down. Seriously. I was feeling good, probably. \"Google your name,\" she says, and hangs up. Weird, right? So, I googled myself.

  "Updated Writing Sample": "```\n[Side_Note] This rephrasing uses a more reflective tone, aligning with the author's persona of grappling with complex emotions. Have you ever woken up and, like, turned on the TV and everything went to crap? I did, I think. [Side_Note] This sentence provides insight into the uncertainty and confusion, reflecting the author's introspective nature. Got out of bed at some time, grabbed my phone, saw my fianc\u00e9e called me a bunch of times, but whatever. So I called her back while going to the bathroom and didn't even know that stuff was about to go wrong. It was supposed to be a great day, I guess. Maybe go biking, go to work, something about a big deal with some company, make money. Later, party with coworkers or something, meet fianc\u00e9e later. But, nope. Nothing goes as planned. [Side_Note] This adds a more descriptive and somber imagery to convey the tension of the situation. The phone buzzes, \"Jackson! Why didn't you pick up?!\" she says, or something to that effect. Are you, like, okay? [Side_Note] This change reflects the author's preference for narrative storytelling and character development. She was being so dramatic. Checked my morning stubble in the mirror. [Side_Note] This reflects the author's desire for subtle introspection. Whatever. \"Did you see the news?\" my fianc\u00e9e practically yells. [Side_Note] Emphasizes the emotional impact of her words. Calm down. Seriously. I was feeling good, probably. [Side_Note] Adds a bit of inner reflection to illustrate the author's heightened emotional state. \"Google your name,\" she says, and hangs up. Weird, right? So, I googled myself. What the heck? [Side_Note] This maintains the uncertainty but with a more analytical tone. News! Killer guy\u2014my picture. Stuff about murders. Uh oh. Did they mess up? Was it me? [Side_Note]This reinforces the tense introspection. I don't know. Thoughts. Jason. Doorbell rings.\n```",
