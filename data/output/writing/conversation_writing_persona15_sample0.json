    "Original Sample": " Friends! I come to you this day, not as a Night Manager, nor even a shift supervisor! I come to you as a friend! A compatriot! A brother in arms!    It has been 2 months since the Sleeping, two long, arduous months! Two months, since our friends and family disappeared in their beds, vanished without a trace. Two months since we were left behind, our noble night shift, left to inherit an abandoned empire!    We have faced many hardships since then, and the trials have been difficult! Many of you bear doubt in your hearts, but fear not, my friends!    When the Noble Nurses of Nightshift called out for aid in procuring supplies for the Sacred Hospital, who answered their call? We did!    When the Followers of Insomnias stumbled forth to our doors, who brought them in? Who fed them, clothed them, and made them not just survivors, but Valued Associates? We did!    And, I may ask, whose Forklift Cavalry broke the lines of the Fast Food Confederation, led by the vile Order of Tacobell? Who bravely beat them back, not just for our own good, but for the good of the entire Tri-County area? WE DID!    And now, despite those accomplishments, despite the glorious successes of our burgeoning empire, I hear doubt. I know of the threat we face, and it is not a small one. The Finalist Legion, even now, marches forth from the halls of their fortress, their State University. They come with the passion and self-righteous fury as can only be found in a college student    But shall we falter? No! We shall meet them upon the field, and the parking lot will run red with their blood! We shall beat down their horde, and never stop fighting, until the last of us ceases to draw breath!    Now, stand fast, meat cutters and shelf stockers! Stand fast, men and women of the registers! Cart pushers and bread bakers, clothes sorters and fish feeders, stand fast! We are mighty! We are proud! WE ARE WAL-MART!   _______________________________________________________  So, this was my second submission to /r/writingprompts. I'd really like to start improving my writing, so any comments and criticism would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

    "Updated Writing Sample": "```plaintext\n[Side_Note: Replace emotional language with a formal tone and structured wording, maintaining objectivity.] Esteemed Colleagues, I address you today not merely as a Night Manager or a shift supervisor, but as a reliable ally. \n\nIt has been two months since what we refer to as the Sleeping, a notably challenging period. It has been two months since our associates vanished without explanation, and we, the night shift team, have assumed responsibility for maintaining operations. \n\nWe have encountered significant challenges since that time, yet let us not be disheartened. [Side_Note: Express accomplishment with a structured and logical progression of ideas.] When the Nightshift Nursing Team required assistance in acquiring supplies for the hospital, it was our team that responded. \n\nWhen individuals affected by insomnia sought assistance, we provided support by accommodating and empowering them as valued team members. \n\nFurthermore, our Forklift Brigade skillfully countered aggressive actions from the Fast Food Confederation, specifically the organized entity known as the Order of Tacobell, with considerable impact on the Tri-County area. \n\nAnd now, despite those accomplishments and the successes of our expanding operations, concerns are heard. We recognize the magnitude of the challenge ahead. [Side_Note: Maintain objective tone without emotional language.] The Finalist Legion, representing the State University, is advancing upon us with notable determination. \n\nNonetheless, we shall not waver. [Side_Note: Emphasize commitment in a structured format.] We shall strategically engage them in the designated area. The exchange will be robust, sustained until our objectives are met. \n\nNow, show readiness, positions across departments\u2014whether meat cutters or shelf stockers, associates of registers, or cart pushers, bread bakers, clothing sorters, or fish care specialists. We maintain strength and pride in our collective identity. WE ARE WAL-MART! \n_______________________________________________________\n\nSo, this presents my subsequent submission to /r/writingprompts. I am eager to enhance my writing and welcome any analytical comments and insights. Thank you.\n```",
