Silence is relative when phones aren't muted.  Hello?    Me.  Such a familiar voice. Why correct him when caller ID exists? Conversation was the thief of my slumber, until sleep reclaimed.

My apartment above, decimated by flooding, a casualty. Seeking haven, I found his space my refuge. Time elapsed where tea replaced drinks tinted with artificial vigor, pillows scented calm. Pills though, ceremony's staple, discarded post-shower in a receptacle.   Sharing dreams wasn\u2019t the duty of a medication, said he. No lover matched in depth as Caspar, a mutual claim. Happiness birthed routine, routine crafted healing. Work's early conclusion once found him off-guard, cocooned in sleep's embrace on the settee. A milestone. His sleep's zenith reached.
