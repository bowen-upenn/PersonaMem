    "Updated Writing Sample": "[Side_Note] The tone is being revised from colloquial to more formal, with precise language and logical flow.\nMy father frequently emphasized that my mother held affection for me. During my childhood, she was emotionally distant and her presence at home was infrequent. In instances when her support was needed, it was absent. Nonetheless, my father professed his profound love for her and affirmed his willingness to do anything to support her, which I accepted. I reciprocated my mother's love. \n\n[Side_Note] The sentence structure has been refined for clarity and conciseness.\nAt that time, my mother exhibited minimal concern for me; however, my father fulfilled her role. He provided the nurturing that traditionally a mother would offer her child. Lacking a nurturing mother, my awareness of this absence was limited. At the park, other children gravitated towards their mothers, seeking snacks and sustenance. Although my mother should have played this role, it was my father who took her place and performed admirably. \n\n[Side_Note] The passage is rewritten in more structured language for clarity.\nIn my early years, my father was an omnipresent figure, embodying the roles of anchor, exemplar, and sole mentor. As I matured, my mother seemed to undergo a transformation, becoming more joyful and amiable. Her previous discontent with myself, my father, and our familial unit seemed to dissipate, replaced by a peculiar fondness. \n\n[Side_Note] Added quotation marks to follow proper formatting and consistent style.\nWhen I reached the age of 14, my father took me aside and made me promise, \"to love my mother eternally. She's attempting to transform for our sake,\" he conveyed. \"She loves us.\" The situation indeed appeared as such, and our family unity and happiness improved significantly. My mother's transformation included fostering a stronger bond with me. She sought pardon for her prior inattention, which I granted, aspiring for familial cohesion akin to others. In response, she smiled and embraced me warmly. \n\n[Side_Note] Sentence restructured for clarity and logical flow.\nHer perfume, characterized by a soft floral and subtle citrus aroma, enveloped me. Despite my general indifference to floral scents and perfumes, hers instilled a sense of calm, allowing me to relax within her embrace. I communicated this to her, prompting frequent hugs, gentle reassurances, and soothing caresses. \n\n[Side_Note] Simplified structure to enhance readability.\nMy father remained a figure of admiration, but I now had my mother's guidance as well. She had become a steadfast presence in our family, leading to an unparalleled sense of contentment and joy. My father's happiness mirrored mine, strengthening our familial bonds beyond the familial paradigm to that of a father and child. \n\n[Side_Note] Clarified timeline and events.\nWhen I turned 40, my father required hospitalization. Prior admissions were for minor ailments, such as colds and fevers. However, he suffered a significant stroke. Upon receiving notification from the hospital, I hurriedly made my way there, only to discover my mother in tears within the waiting area. Medical professionals reassured us of his potential recovery. \n\n[Side_Note] Structured to convey events chronologically and logically.\nSix hours later, he succumbed to his condition, leaving my mother and me in profound sorrow. As we departed the premises, I experienced the parental void, haunted by thoughts of possibly spending more time with him and pondering unresolved regrets. \n\n[Side_Note] Formal conclusion with explicit anniversary mention.\nToday commemorates the 20th anniversary of my matrimonial union. My affection for my spouse is absolute; she represents the epitome of joy in my life, and envisioning a single day without her is inconceivable. Recently, I extended an invitation to my mother to partake in the celebratory event, expressing a desire for reminiscence and strengthened interactions between us. Her acceptance was heartening. After deliberation with my spouse, we resolved to allow our children to stay with her parents, recognizing the special nature of our anniversary. \n\n[Side_Note] Precise and respectful descriptions enhanced with industry-specific wording.\nSeated at a table amidst those I cherish, I express gratitude for their presence, acknowledging both my wife and mother, affirming, \"I can now love both of you, in perpetuity.\" Subsequently, I embrace them, connecting deeply and sincerely.\n\n[Side_Note] Signature added to adhere to proper formatting.\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Side_Note] Author's initials for signature.\nA.B.C.",

    "Original Sample": "My father always told me that my mother loved me. As a child, she was distant, and she was rarely at home. When I needed her, she was never there for me. But my father also told me that he loved her, and that he would do anything for her, and I accepted it. I loved my mother.   Back then, my mother never cared much for me, but in her place, there was my father. My father cared for me, and he did all that a mother should've done for her child. My mother had never been caring, so I did not have a caring mother -- but I did not know my loss. When we went to the park, the other children gathered around their mothers, asking for snacks and food. I knew that my mother should have been the one to humour me, but instead, I had my father. And in her place, he did a fine job.   In my youth, my father was my everything -- he was my rock, my role model, and my sole guide. As I grew, my mother seemed to become happier and more cheerful. Her dissatisfaction with me, with my father, and with our family seemed to ebb. In its place, there grew a sort of odd fondness.   When I was 14, my father took me to the side, and with him, I promised that I would love my mother forever.    She's trying to change for us,  he said.  She loves us.    And it seemed to be that way, and we were all happy. Indeed, my mother slowly changed, and she changed for all the better -- instead of distance, we formed a close relationship. She apologized for all the years during which she had n't paid attention to me, and I, wishing for our family to become like all the others, accepted her apology. When I did, she smiled, and hugged me tight. I could smell her perfume -- soft, floral, and with a faint hint of citrus. I had never like the scent of flowers ( nor that of perfume ) very much, but hers calmed me, and I relaxed into her embrace. I told her this, and she began to hug me frequently, soothing me with soft words and gently cuddling me.   I still admired my father greatly, but now, I had another guide -- my mother. She was finally there for me, and for our family. I was content and cheerful like never before. And my father, too, was happy. We grew closer, not only as family, but also as a father and his child.   When I was 40, my father had to go to the hospital. Before that, he'd been in and out of the hospital, but there was nothing truly severe -- just a few colds, and a fever or two. But then he'd had a stroke. When the hospital called me, I rushed to arrive as quickly as I could, and I found my mother sobbing in the waiting room. We were told that he would probably make it.   He passed six hours later, and my mother and I wept. I cried as we were escorted from the room. Then, I knew the loss of a parent, and I felt haunted -- what if I had spent more time with him? Would I still regret not being there for him?   Today is the 20th anniversary of my marriage. I love my wife -- she's my sunshine and my absolute everything, and I ca n't think of living a day without her. A few days ago, I asked my mother if she would come celebrate with us, and I'd like to reminisce and catch up with her a bit more, too. She agreed, and that made my day. I talked it over with my wife, and we decided to send the children to her parents' family -- after all, it was a special occasion for us.   Now, sitting around a table and surrounded by people I love, I grin mischievously at my wife.    You look gorgeous, hun,  I say.   She's smiling at me, and there's a blush on her face. I go up to her, and I hug her from behind. Then, I hug my mother, who's seated beside her.    I'm so glad you're here with me, today,  I say.  I can love both of you, now and forever.    They do n't reply.     //.   //.   please have mercy on my first story. any critiques are appreciated! "
