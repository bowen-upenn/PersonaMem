    "Original Sample": "London has always been a busy city, enriched by the type of old history that can only be found in the thick quarry stone. The history seeps through the cinder blocks and grates that make up the old aqueducts that once lead the filthy lard infested waters into the bay. It can be found within the hard oak wood that make the foundation for the diplomatic caf\u00e9s that were once filled with the air of dignity and appreciation of wisdom and knowledge, a place for political sovereignty. That is a time long gone, however. Now the shops and houses are built with hardened steel, the water runs clean and the caf\u00e9s are but a shadow of their old self. Instead, in their place lay new chains of so called *bistro's*, with their so called *baristas*.   It is here I have made my place over the last few weeks, within this mockery of a phrontistery, as if the thoughts and ideas spread here are anything but shallow and vein. I have forced myself to accompany the patrons of this squalor in their fashion, wearing rounded glasses to display my neatly trimmed beard. Accompanied by the loosely fit safari jacket and slack chinos. Here I spend my time, drinking the repugnant fly repellent they call an espresso, which they have managed to make even more vile today. This is what I have to do, to observe my next mark.   His name is Gordon Lawinsky, and he is every bit the high and mighty advice giver, self acclaimed actor, movie write, philosopher and the occasional fitness instructor just like the other inhabitants of this establishment. He is the type of man I portray myself to be, and he shall be the next notch upon my belt. He makes the same order every morning, double espresso latte. Placing himself at the far end of the room, lounging in the nonchalant sort of way that is only possible to accomplish if you sit uncomfortably. Although he always makes himself occupied, he is never busy, never actually doing anything. Every day he tries to stay focused on his phone, or newspaper but every now and then he casts the occasional glance in my direction, followed by a brief smile.   One can only assume that the looks we share are of admiration and attraction to one another, but I have a greater motive. People say that the ecstasy that is released in the act of love making is the most powerful feeling in the world. I beg to differ, for I have held another man's life in my hands, and watched as the light drained from his eyes as I snuffed it out with the slit of my knife. There is no purer, cleaner feeling in this world. As I finish of the black abomination in my cup he looks up me, smiling, as the darkness collapses around my eyes.",

    "Updated Writing Sample": "[Side_Note: Adapting to a humorous and casual tone with Finnish idioms]\nLondon has always been a bustling place, busier than a Finnish sauna on a winter's day, with all that thick quarry stone telling old tales. The history seeps through the cinder blocks and grates that make up the old aqueducts that once led the murky, lard-laden waters into the bay. It can be found within the hard oak wood that makes the foundation for the diplomatic caf\u00e9s that were once filled with an air of dignity and a thirst for wisdom and knowledge, a spot for political sovereignty. \n\n[Side_Note: Informal wording and playful language]\nThat was a time long gone, though, now as gone as yesterday\u2019s sauna steam. Nowadays the shops and houses are built with hardened steel, the water runs clean, and the caf\u00e9s are a pale shadow of their old selves. Instead, in their place, you find flashy *bistro's*, with their so-called *baristas*. Here I have made my place over the last few weeks, within this mockery of a coffee house, as if the thoughts and ideas spread here are anything but shallow and vain. I've forced myself to mingle with the patrons of this squalor in their fashion, sporting rounded glasses to complement my neatly trimmed beard, like I'm ready for a comedy act. Accompanied by a loosely fitted safari jacket and slack chinos, here I am, sipping on the repugnant fly spray they lovingly call espresso\u2014which is even more loathsome today, mind you. This is what one has to endure to mark out the next target. \n\n[Side_Note: Use of Finnish idiom and humorous tone]\nAh, his name is Gordon Lawinsky, a classic example of a man puffed up like a moose at the first sight of spring. He styles himself as an actor, movie writer, philosopher, and occasional fitness instructor, just like the rest of this caf\u00e9 club. He's every bit the image I project myself to be, and soon he'll be just another carelessly carved notch on my stick. Gordon makes the same order every morning, a double espresso latte. He loafs at the far side of the room, lounging like he's buttering bread with his elbows. Even though he's always pretending to keep busy, he's never really doing much of anything\u2014except occasionally peeking over at me, with that brief little smirk. \n\n[Side_Note: Use of exaggeration and informal language]\nWe exchange glances, and one might think it's mutual admiration or attraction, but I've got a grander scheme up my sleeve, you see. Folks claim that the ecstasy released during lovemaking is unbeatable\u2014well, I beg to disagree, because there\u2019s nothing quite like the clean feeling of having another man's life in your grip, watching the light fade from his eyes as you... well, get the picture. As I finally down the cup of black slapstick comedy gone wrong, he looks up at me, smiling, and the darkness tumbles down around my eyes.",
