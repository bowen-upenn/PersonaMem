    "Updated Writing Sample": "```\n[Side_Note] Applying positive and engaging tone: In our vibrant world where conflicts big and small are playfully resolved through epic trading card games, a legendary duel took place between President Barack Obama of the United States and President Vladimir Putin of Russia. [Side_Note] Making it conversational and using informal language: Picture this, folks: the grand stage for this friendly face-off, to end the second Cold War.\n\nWait, if it's a *Cold War*, why the hell are they actually dueling? Wouldn't they just pussyfoot around the matter with threats of invading America with Snowman Eaters, or Russia with Absolute Crusaders? Proxy warfare between guerrilla duelists supporting each others' enemies would be acceptable! Even in this world, there should be *some* semblance of deterrence!\n\n[Side_Note] Incorporating engaging personality by addressing the audience directly: They're dueling because I said so, Billy. Now settle down and let me tell you the tale!\n\n[Side_Note] Engaging the readers: Alright, Billy agreed, a hint of anticipation in his voice.\n\nObama and Putin met on neutral ground in sunny South Africa to settle this exciting match. Their decks were reviewed by impartial officials, ensuring a fair and thrilling duel. As the leaders exchanged pleasantries at the center, excitement buzzed through the crowd, stirred by the duel's grand significance.\n\nPresidents Obama and Putin turned at the referee's signal, withdrew their duel disks, and exclaimed, \"It's time to duel!\"\n\n[Side_Note] Conversational interjection with a side note: So what happens from there, you ask? Ever so curious, aren't we, Billy?\n\nBilly, stop interrupting me and just let me finish. You'll have the answers to that question soon enough.\n\nBilly was noticeably agitated at the fact that over 5 minutes had passed since I started the story, and yet the actual duel hadn't happened yet. Worry not, we'll get there soon.\n\nAnd by soon, I mean right now! Each duelist drew 5 cards and began the game. President Obama took the first turn. His hand consisted of 3 Spell Cards, 1 Trap Card, and 1 Monster Card.\n\n[Side_Note] Adding excitement with emoji and vivid description: President Obama, with the confidence of a true strategist \ud83d\udcaa, declared, \"Alright Mr. Putin, I'll start this duel in true American style! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 I activate the Field Spell Card, **Cultural Melting Pot**! Each unique creature on my side boosts others, forming an unstoppable alliance. Plus, I'll draw fresh recruits from my deck each turn.\"\n\nFrom there, I'll activate another Spell Card, **Reinforcement of the Army**! This card lets me add one Level 4 Warrior-type monster from my Deck to my hand. I'll add **Freedom Fighter** and then Normal Summon it!\n\n> Freedom Fighter/Level 4/Warrior/EARTH/Effect/1600/1000\n\nPresident Obama continued, \"When **Freedom Fighter** is summoned, I can Special Summon **Justice Eagle** to the field in Defense Position. Also, the stealthy **Kagetokage** joins in, summoned due to **Freedom Fighter**'s inspiration!\"\n\n> Justice Eagle/Level 4/Winged-Beast/LIGHT/Effect/1000/2000\n\n> Kagetokage/Level 4/Reptile/DARK/Effect/1100/1500\n\nI set two Spell or Trap Cards face-down and proceed to my End Phase. At this time, I activate the effect of **Cultural Melting Pot**, choosing to add a non-Warrior/Winged-Beast/Reptile monster from my Deck to my hand. I'll add **Presidential Task Force** and then end my turn.\n\n> Presidential Task Force/Level 7/Rock/Effect/2600/2100\n\n___\n\n> President Obama's Gamestate:\n> * 3 Monsters on field, all with +600 ATK/DEF ( **Freedom Fighter** has 2200 ATK, **Justice Eagle** has 2600 DEF, **Kagetokage** has 2100 DEF )\n> * 1 Field Spell Card active\n> * 2 Set Spell or Trap Cards\n> * 1 card in hand\n\n[Side_Note] Softening competitive dialogue: \"You've crafted a formidable defense, Mr. Obama. Russia stands prepared! My move, draw!\" Putin declared, surveying the battlefield.\n\nPresident Putin's hand consisted of 6 cards since he went second: 4 Trap Cards, 1 Monster Card, and 1 Spell Card.\n\nPutin continued his turn, \"Mr. Obama, patience is a virtue, isn't it? You rushed your forces onto the stage, but you've only one card left?\"\n\n\"I guess we'll find out,\" President Obama responded with a smile.\n\n[Side_Note] Making interaction engaging and vivid: A crafty grin appeared on Putin's face. \"Let's see how you handle this! I activate the Spell Card **Dark Hole**! This will sweep your forces away!\"\n\n[Side_Note] Adding dramatic flair: \"Hold on, Mr. Putin!\" Obama interjected fiercely. \"In politics and battles, one must be tactical. **Dark Bribe** will stop your attack, letting you draw one card, but your **Dark Hole** is nullified!\"\n\nBut Mr. Obama, you let me dig one card deeper to protect your monsters. And Russia is not without its resources to take this duel from you. Draw!\n\nIt was at this point that Billy decided to act on his usual terrible timing and yell, *Booooooooooooring*. You're a terrible storyteller, sir! Just skip to the good stuff and leave out all this technical crap!\n\nAt this point, I was exasperated with Billy, but I knew I needed to keep his and the rest of my audience's focus to finish this tale, so I relented and skipped to the climax of the duel.\n\n[Side_Note] Clarifying with friendly vibe: Alright Billy, I'll fast forward to the thrilling finale! \n\nPresident Putin had just unleashed an onslaught of cards on President Obama. He controlled five monsters (all of which were either bears, special forces, or snow monsters) and had 3000 Life Points, compared to President Obama's 100 Life Points.\n\n[Side_Note] Creating suspense with vivid wording: Picture the tension in the air, dear readers! Mr. Obama stood with just **Presidential Task Force**, striving against overwhelming odds. Yet he drew a card with unwavering resolve. Could this be the turning point?\n\n[Side_Note] Evoking heroism and adventure: \"Mr. Putin, the tide still may turn!\" Obama announced heroically as he drew his card. [Side_Note] Adding light-hearted interaction: \"Topdecking victory? Yes, indeed! I play **Fire Raid**, breathing life anew with fiery resolve! Each of your monsters burns 400 of your Life Points away, leaving you with 1000!\"\n\nAnd you remember the effect of my **Presidential Task Force**, right? When I inflict damage to my opponent, whether through battle or by effect, I can Special Summon **Special Assault Team** from my Deck!\n\n> Special Assault Team/Level 1/Warrior/EARTH/0/0\n\nWhat?! President Putin was visibly stunned; none of his monsters could stop the coming effect of **Special Assault Team**.\n\n\"This is it, President Putin! You meet your match, and America rises triumphant! **Special Assault Team**, self-sacrifice to clear his field! Now, I'll attack directly, sealing this duel!\" Obama concluded with vigor.\n\nAnd so that is the (admittedly abridged) tale of President Obama vs President Putin. Although Russia remained a sovereign nation, the United States was able to see several of its demands fulfilled.\n\nWhat the hell was *that*?\n\nBilly was, as usual, noticeably upset.\n\nThat was a horrible way to end the duel! Obama was thoroughly outclassed by Putin but had some cheap bullshit card that just so happened to help him win the game. This sounds just like those scripted television shows. Your story sucks!\n\nWell Billy, that's how it is. But you know, I heard Putin wanted a rematch with Obama, so maybe next time things will go differently.\n\n[Side_Note] Ending on an engaging note: With a grin, Billy remarked, \"Next time, let's see if someone else tells the tale!\" \n```",

    "Original Sample": "In a world where everything from petty fights between angsty teenagers to international conflicts led by world leaders are settled through trading card games based on duel monsters, one showdown stands foremost in the annals of history : the epic face-off between President Barack Obama of the United States of America and President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation. The one duel to end the second Cold War. One duel for all the cards, figuratively speaking.    Wait, if it's a *Cold War*, why the hell are they actually dueling? Would n't they just pussyfoot around the matter with threats of invading America with Snowman Eaters, or Russia with Absolute Crusaders? Proxy warfare between guerrilla duelists supporting each others' enemies would be acceptable! Even in this world, there should be *some* semblance of deterrence!     They're dueling because I said so, Billy. Now shut up and let me finish my story!     Okay,  Billy acquiesced.   Now, where was I?   Obama and Putin met on neutral ground in South Africa to settle this game. Both leaders' decks were reviewed by a team of neutral parties and approved for the duel. They met at the center of the arena and exchanged niceties before turning 180 degrees and marching ten paces to the opposite ends of the stadium. The crowd watched in suspense, stirred by the importance of this battle as much as by the intense heat. Presidents Obama and Putin turned at the referee's signal, withdrew their duel disks, and exclaimed,  It's time to duel!     So what happens from there?     Billy, stop interrupting me and just let me finish. You'll have the answers to that question soon enough.    Billy was noticeably agitated at the fact that over 5 minutes had passed since I started the story, and yet the actual duel had n't happened yet. Worry not, we'll get there soon.   And by soon, I mean right now! Each duelist drew 5 cards and began the game. President Obama took the first turn. His hand consisted of 3 Spell Cards, 1 Trap Card, and 1 Monster Card.    Alright Mr. Putin, I'll start this duel in true American fashion. I activate the Field Spell Card, **Cultural Melting Pot**! As long as this card remains face-up on my side of the field, all face-up monsters on my side of the field gain 300 ATK and DEF for each face-up monster on my side of the field with a different Type than that monster. Additionally, at my End Phase, if I control at least two face-up monsters with a different Type, I can add 1 monster from my Deck to my hand, whose Type is different from any Type of monster currently on my field.   From there, I'll activate another Spell Card, **Reinforcement of the Army**! This card lets me add one Level 4 Warrior-type monster from my Deck to my hand. I'll add **Freedom Fighter** and then Normal Summon it!    > Freedom Fighter/Level 4/Warrior/EARTH/Effect/1600/1000   President Obama continued,  When **Freedom Fighter** is successfully Normal Summoned, I can Special Summon one **Justice Eagle** from my Deck in Defense Position. Additionally, I chain the effect of **Kagetokage** in my hand to the effect of **Freedom Fighter**, which allows me to Special Summon it when I Normal Summon a Level 4 monster! **Kagetokage** will also be summoned in Defense Position.    > Justice Eagle/Level 4/Winged-Beast/LIGHT/Effect/1000/2000   > Kagetokage/Level 4/Reptile/DARK/Effect/1100/1500    I set two Spell or Trap Cards face-down and proceed to my End Phase. At this time, I activate the effect of **Cultural Melting Pot**, choosing to add a non-Warrior/Winged-Beast/Reptile monster from my Deck to my hand. I'll add **Presidential Task Force** and then end my turn.    > Presidential Task Force/Level 7/Rock/Effect/2600/2100   ___   > President Obama's Gamestate :   > * 3 Monsters on field, all with +600 ATK/DEF ( **Freedom Fighter** has 2200 ATK, **Justice Eagle** has 2600 DEF, **Kagetokage** has 2100 DEF )   > * 1 Field Spell Card active   > * 2 Set Spell or Trap Cards   > * 1 card in hand    Well done, Mr. Obama. You've set up an interesting assortment of obstacles for me to overcome. That said, Russia will persevere! My turn, draw!    President Putin's hand consisted of 6 cards since he went second : 4 Trap Cards, 1 Monster Card, and 1 Spell Card.   Putin continued his turn.  Mr. Obama, are you familiar with the concept of knowing when to hold your cards until the time is right? You've played three monsters on the first turn, all strengthened by that Field Spell of yours, but you only have one card in hand. What would happen if I were to tear your field apart?     I guess we'll have to see, Mr. Putin,  President Obama replied.    Hmm... very well. I'll activate the Spell Card **Dark Hole**! This Spell Card will destroy all monsters on the field!     Not so fast, Mr. Putin! See, politics can sometimes get dirty, and while I'm not one to stoop to breaking the law, I will use whatever means necessary to win this duel! I chain **Dark Bribe** to your **Dark Hole**. You get to draw 1 card from your Deck, but in exchange, your Spell Card's activation is negated and destroyed!     But Mr. Obama, you let me dig one card deeper to protect your monsters. And Russia is not without its resources to take this duel from you. Draw!    It was at this point that Billy decided to act on his usual terrible timing and yell,  *Booooooooooooring*. You're a terrible storyteller, sir! Just skip to the good stuff and leave out all this technical crap!    At this point, I was exasperated with Billy, but I knew I needed to keep his and the rest of my audience's focus to finish this tale, so I relented and skipped to the climax of the duel.    Alright Billy, as you wish. I'll skip to the final turn of the duel.    President Putin had just unleashed an onslaught of cards on President Obama. He controlled five monsters ( all of which were either bears, special forces, or snow monsters ) and had 3000 Life Points, compared to President Obama's 100 Life Points. President Obama had **Presidential Task Force** on the field, but had lost all of his other cards on the field and in his hand, so he needed his deck to pull ~~deus ex machina bullshit~~ a miracle.    Mr. Putin, although I may be battered, I am not broken, and I will bring victory to America! Draw!    And Mr. Obama, with one of those exaggerated drawing motions these kinds of duelists are known for, took the top card from his deck and smiled.    Mr. Putin, are you familiar with the concept of topdecking? You seemed all too happy to lecture me on my use of cards before, but it looks like today's victory is mine. I'll fight your Russian Winter with fire! I activate the Spell Card **Fire Raid**! This card inflicts 400 damage to my opponent for each monster on their side of the field, leaving you with 1000 Life Points. And you remember the effect of my **Presidential Task Force**, right? When I inflict damage to my opponent, whether through battle or by effect, I can Special Summon **Special Assault Team** from my Deck!    > Special Assault Team/Level 1/Warrior/EARTH/0/0    What?!  President Putin was noticeably enraged, knowing that none of the monsters on his side of the field could negate the effect of **Special Assault Team**.    This is it, President Putin! You're finished, and the United States of America will see its proposals acted upon! **Special Assault Team's** effect activates! When Special Summoned by the effect of **Presidential Task Force**, it can Tribute itself to destroy all monsters on your side of the field! The only downside to this is that I can not Special Summon for the rest of this turn. But my Battle Phase is intact! I switch **Presidential Task Force** to ATK Position and attack your Life Points directly, ending the duel!    And so that is the ( admittedly abridged ) tale of President Obama vs President Putin. Although Russia remained a sovereign nation, the United States was able to see several of its demands fulfilled.    What the hell was *that*?    Billy was, as usual, noticeably upset.    That was a horrible way to end the duel! Obama was thoroughly outclassed by Putin but had some cheap bullshit card that just so happened to help him win the game. This sounds just like those scripted television shows. Your story sucks!     Well Billy, that's how it is. But you know, I heard Putin wanted a rematch with Obama, so maybe next time things will go differently.    Billy agreed, but followed,  Hopefully next time, it's not you who's telling the story. "
