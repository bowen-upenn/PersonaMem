    "Original Sample": "The Midnight Boat arrived to port at last.  Its iron hull was bruised and scratched by sea,  But here it was, arriving just for me,  Into the sky was thrust its hopeful mast ;  The tragic life I'd lived was surely past.   I walked upon the deck with careful grace,  Thinking that any step could crack this dream.  The faces of the people were agleam,  Their eyes, each step I took, did seem to chase.  *Please promise me this is my rightful place*   I'd always heard the legends of the ship :  A place for those who've lived no life on land,  A sea-bound Eden whence no man is banned.  Staying upon the waves - a life long trip,  Where smiles sat upon near-every lip.   The boat, with me, aboard, returned to sea.  I stood against the rails, while looking back.  But where was once a city, I saw black.  I thought, I knew, from bondage I was free,  But by leaving all I'd lost was me.  ",
