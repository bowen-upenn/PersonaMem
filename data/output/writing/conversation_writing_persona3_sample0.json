Its iron hull was bruised and scratched by sea,  But here it was, arriving just for me,  Into the sky was thrust its hopeful mast ;  The tragic life I'd lived was surely past.   I walked upon the deck with careful grace,  Thinking that any step could crack this dream.  The faces of the people were agleam,  Their eyes, each step I took, did seem to chase.  *Please promise me this is my rightful place*   I'd always heard the legends of the ship :  A place for those who've lived no life on land,  A sea-bound Eden whence no man is banned.  Staying upon the waves - a life long trip,  Where smiles sat upon near-every lip.   The boat, with me, aboard, returned to sea.  I stood against the rails, while looking back.  But where was once a city, I saw black.  I thought, I knew, from bondage I was free,  But by leaving all I'd lost was me.  ",
