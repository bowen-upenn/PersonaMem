Your son\u2019s safety is at risk, and now that the townspeople are aware of the situation, his presence here endangers him further,\" the leading man explained.\n\n\"But can't I accompany him?\" she implored.\n\n\"The current protocol does not allow for such arrangements, Ma'am,\" the man responded, turning away from her. \n\nThomas was waiting in his room like his mother had instructed him, hoping for the best but expecting the worst. \n\n[Side_Note] Maintain paragraph structure and formal language: Should someone other than his mother enter, he knew he might never return to this house or see her again. They had exchanged a hurried farewell before she went to answer the door. It was a routine they had rehearsed countless times, one seemingly without consequence\u2014until now. This instinct, the same one that had forewarned him of a theft about to occur, told him this time was different.\n\n[Side_Note] Objective and formal language: It was the same instinct that had enabled him to destroy the thief with mere thought, a part of him devoid of regret. Thomas understood he was unlike everyone he'd ever known. Normal people could not incinerate a man with a simple nod of their head.\n\nThomas was not a normal person. Not just because of his abilities, but because he refused to rely on others to solve his problems.\n\n[Side_Note] Subsections with headings and detailed title: Here begins the chronicles of Thomas Leasy: The Greymarked, The Last of the Magicians, and the First to Defy the Oracle.
