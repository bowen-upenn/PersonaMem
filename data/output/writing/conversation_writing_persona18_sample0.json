    "Original Sample": " You know that song, by Green Day, it has the line'When masturbation's lost its fun'? That's been my life for about five thousand years now.  I told her as I sighed and put down my glass full of ice and whisky.  Honestly, I'm just kind of bored at this point.     Sure. OK.  She rolled her eyes.  You know I'm not buying any of this right?     That's fine. I'm not selling it. I'm just telling you what it's like. There's a couple verse from Ecclesiastes : what has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun. I knew the guy who wrote that, it was true then, and it's true now. I guess iPhones were cool for, maybe, six months.     So, you're immortal, and all you do is sit around in bars and bitch to random women about how bored you are?     Well, I would n't put it like that...    How would you put it?     Uh, I mean, I do stuff.     Such as?    Mostly, I wait for a time when I can explore the stars.  ",
