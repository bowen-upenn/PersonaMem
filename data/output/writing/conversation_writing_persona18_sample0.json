    "Original Sample": "Once upon a time, there was a man with a bloody scar on his temple named Samuel Fitzberger. He lived alone on top of a big, tall mountain. The neighborhood children all had stories about Mr. Fitzberger. They claimed that if any child trespassed on his mountain, they would be eaten alive by the Fitzberger. Little Danny Pendleton was not afraid of such stories. He talked to his friends and he was able to convince them all to go camp out on the Fitzberger mountain one dark and stormy night.   The boys hiked up the side of the mountain that happened to be right next to their quaint and cozy suburb. Little Johnny Fatfingers complained that he felt out of breath. The boys made fun of him for being fat and having glasses. Little Johnny Fatfingers cried and bailed on them, and started down the mountain alone. The boys laughed and made more fat and glasses jokes down at Little Johnny Fatfingers as his figure slowly disappeared into the distance. Little Danny Pendleton had a look of disappointment and resentment on his face, but continued to lead the other boys up the mountain.   Up the mountain, the boys kept hearing creepy noises. They heard owls hooting, bats screeching, crickets chirping, feral cats growling, coyotes howling, thunder clapping, and stuff like that. Little Hugh Scaredycat began to cry and said he was scared of going any further up the mountain. The boys laughed and made fun of him for being a scaredy cat, and suddenly his last name seemed all the more appropriate which was really unfortunate for Hugh, because it \u2019 s like, how was he ever gon na live that down now? So Little Hugh Scaredycat ran down the mountain until his figure too became nonexistent in the distance. Little Danny Pendleton squinted his eyes at the fading figure, then turned himself forward and motioned for the remaining boys to follow him.   Little Danny Pendleton and the boys finally reached the top of the mountain. On the top of the mountain, there was a dilapidated cottage. Little Fearlesskidwholikestopickontheotherkidsfornotbeingfearless Brown stepped forward and bragged that he would be the first to look inside. He stepped up to the door and slowly reached his hand out to turn the door knob slowly and anticipatorily and also slowly. The other boys looked on in horror. Little Fearlesskidwholikestopickontheotherkidsfornotbeingfearless gleefully chortled as he flung the door wide open.   \u201c See, there \u2019 s nobody\u2014 \u201c But there was somebody. Little Fearlesskidwholikestopickontheotherkidsfornotbeingfearless was promptly disemboweled by a shadowy figure. The other boys screamed. Little Danny Pendleton pulled out his pocket knife and moved toward the shadowy figure.   \u201c Samuel Fitzberger! We have to come to deliver you to your maker! \u201d The rest of the boys groaned at Little Danny Pendleton \u2019 s total lameness. Three of the boys actually turned around and walked home, because of how much what he said sucked. The shadowy figure eviscerated Little Danny Pendleton with its teeth. The boys screamed. When suddenly, a cry from the woods :   \u201c I am the plot device that ends up saving the remaining victims in this horror story! \u201d The shadowy figure turned its ugly head towards the woods. A figure emerged from the woods. It was none other than Samuel Fitzberger.   \u201c This is my forest. And you would do kindly to leave these kids alone. \u201d   The shadowy figure and Samuel Fitzberger fought to the death. The shadowy figure \u2019 s death. Samuel Fitzberger won. The boys all cheered. One of the boys chirped up :   \u201c Wow, I \u2019 m never gon na judge a weird stranger off of urban legends ever again! \u201d Another one cried : \u201c Yeah, wow, don \u2019 t judge a book by its cover, even if that cover is actually just the misconceptions of others and not actually a cover as in what the person appears to be or what they look like or things like that! \u201d Yet another child said : \u201c Old people CAN be cool! \u201d   The old man smiled down at the boys. The boys smiled up at the old man. In the moonlight, they were finally able to see the clothing of their savior. It was the skin of Little Johnny Fatfingers and Little Hugh Scaredycat. The old man slaughtered the remaining boys and ate them and also wore their skin. Nobody learned anything, books are stupid, the end. ",

    "Updated Writing Sample": "```\n[Side_Note] The original sentence uses a casual tone, which doesn't align with the analytical tone preferred by the author.\nOnce upon a time, a solitary man named Samuel Fitzberger, with a notable scar on his temple, resided alone atop a lofty mountain.\n\nThe neighborhood children shared tales about Mr. Fitzberger. They claimed if any child trespassed on his mountain, they would be eaten alive by the Fitzberger. Little Danny Pendleton was not afraid of such stories. He talked to his friends and he was able to convince them all to camp out on the Fitzberger mountain one stormy night.\n\n[Side_Note] The original tone was informal with casual mentions and could be structured better, aligning with clear subsections.\nThe boys hiked up the mountain adjacent to their quaint suburb. Little Johnny Fatfingers complained of feeling out of breath. The boys mocked him for his weight and spectacles. Little Johnny Fatfingers, distraught, abandoned them and descended the mountain alone. The boys laughed and continued their ridicule as his figure faded from view. Little Danny Pendleton, visibly disappointed, pressed onward and encouraged the others.\n\nUp the mountain, unsettling sounds echoed around them \u2013 from owls, bats, crickets, cats, coyotes, to the rumble of thunder. Little Hugh Scaredycat expressed his fear and hesitated. The boys ridiculed him further, intensifying his unfortunate nickname. So, Little Hugh Scaredycat retreated down the mountain until he vanished in the distance. Little Danny Pendleton squinted at the retreating figure, then resolutely turned to lead the rest.\n\n[Side_Note] The use of excessively long compound expressions is avoided, aligning with concise paragraph length.\nLittle Danny Pendleton and the remaining boys arrived at the mountain\u2019s peak, where a dilapidated cottage stood. Little Fearless Brown stepped forward, boasting he\u2019d be the first to investigate. He approached the door, his hand reaching to turn the knob, building anticipation. The other boys watched in horror. He gleefully flung open the door.\n\n\u201cSee, there\u2019s nobody\u2014\u201d But there was indeed someone. Little Fearless Brown was promptly attacked by a shadowy figure. The boys screamed. Little Danny Pendleton, undeterred, drew his pocket knife.\n\n\u201cSamuel Fitzberger! We are here to face you!\u201d said Little Danny Pendleton, failing to excite his peers. The shadowy figure attacked him next, drawing more screams.\n\nSuddenly, a voice echoed from the woods: \u201cI am the plot device that saves the victims!\u201d\n\nThe shadowy figure turned. Emerging from the woods was Samuel Fitzberger.\n\n\u201cThis is my forest. Leave these kids alone.\u201d\n\nThe shadowy figure attacked, but Samuel Fitzberger triumphed. The boys cheered.\n\n[Side_Note] The original closing was abrupt and lacked a reflective tone, contrary to the author\u2019s preference for balance and inquiry.\n\u201cWow, I\u2019ll never judge someone based solely on legends again!\u201d said one boy. Another added, \u201cIndeed, appearances can be deceiving!\u201d Another chimed, \u201cOld people can indeed be remarkable!\u201d\n\nThe old man and boys exchanged smiles, understanding resonating in the moonlight. They realized the importance of truth beyond tales, concluding this transformative night.\n```",
