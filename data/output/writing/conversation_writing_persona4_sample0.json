Such matters were deadly serious and deserving of thorough consideration.\n\n[Side_Note: Use of detailed language to avoid informalities.] Despite the grave nature of the threat, the situation was not without its moments of irony for Daniel, who had been the subject of ridicule throughout much of his life.\n\n[Side_Note: Consistent formal tone.] Daniel endeavored to ascertain the geographical location of the two antagonists. His search brought him to a cave situated on the opposite side of the virtual continent, adjacent to one of the game's largest urban centers. \n\nDaniel messaged his buddies to set up shop in the city. A few minutes and plenty more money than he had wished to spend later, he came upon their base. He said to his buddies, All right, let's show these trolls how to fight. \n\n[Side_Note: Use of historical context and passive voice for analysis.] Through strategic execution and determination, they managed to overcome the adversaries, though not without cost\u2014Daniel's medic became a casualty of the encounter.\n\n[Side_Note: Clear paragraph structure.] Nevertheless, the design of the game allowed for the medic's revival a brief moment before the adversaries would make their reappearance. We need our medic before we can do anything else, anyway. \n\nAnother minute or two and they had arrived at the city. You guys go to an Inn and heal up. I'll stay here and pick up Ben. \n\n[Side_Note: Objectivity and passive voice.] Perhaps. Daniel allowed a hint of amusement to cross his expression. The guild had been founded two months prior, with the expressed goal of systematically eliminating disruptive players, known as trolls, from their virtual environments.\n\n[Side_Note: Formal tone and historical context.] Upon being vanquished by the guild, these players would face persistent opposition across multiple instances, prompting their eventual retreat.\n\nWhat his guildmates did n't know, however, is that Daniel was a member of the Online Cyberbullying Anti-Terrorist Alliance, or the OCATA for short. He was by far the youngest, but most successful out of all of his colleagues, and had received several virtual ( and a few physical! ) medals for his success. \n\nThe pillories had been constructed where the trolls would spawn, ripe for the throwing of rotten tomatoes. Ben shifted awkwardly near the guild members who had built the pillories.\n\nOver here! Daniel waved. Ben looked relieved. Good, you showed up. How are the others? \n\nThey're at the Inn, healing. Just then a man from the crowd yelled. They had spawned into the pillories! Daniel helped his guildmates and various members from the crowd to move the pillories away from spawn, but close enough people returning could see what was going on.\n\n'You'll pay for this!' One of them logged out. The other stayed until he realized that the rotten tomatoes actually stole money from him, and everyone laughed as he tried to log out, but the game's combat logging system prevented him from doing so. \n\nDaniel messaged his guildmates, congratulating them on a job well done. He also messaged his friends in the OCATA with the IP address of where the trolls had logged out from. The badges next to his name showed his prestige, and the OCATA, as promised, paid the fee for the sponsorship of the guild to the guild advertisements.\n\n[Side_Note: Use of analytical language for coherence.] He left his guild a well-considered note:\n\nDear fellow guild members, it pleases me greatly to inform you that our collaborative efforts have met with empirical success, warranting the promotion of our objectives to the forefront of competitive standings and forum advertisements.\n\nThank you for your invaluable contributions to the advancement of our guild's goals.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Side_Note: Consistent signature style.] Head_Moderator, of the Banhammer Guild.\n\nDaniel! Dinner's ready! \n\nOn my way! Daniel put his computer into 'panic mode', to look like a regular browser and games. His mother would kill him if she knew he was playing *World of Warcraft*. He shivered at the thought.\n```",

Bullying kids online. It has been assumed to be successful, as the amount of school shootings and suicides has increased dramatically. They were just as set on killing as many innocent westerners as possible. It was deadly serious business.   But, for someone who had been picked on his whole life, it was funny.    Enjoying yourselves?  Daniel attempted to locate the two trolls on his map. He found them in a cave on the other side of the continent, by one of the largest cities in the game.

Another minute or two and they had arrived at the city.  You guys go to an Inn and heal up. I'll stay here and pick up Ben.     You just want to taunt those morons, do n't you?     Maybe.  Daniel grinned. His guild had been founded two months ago. Their goal was to force any and all trolls out of the game and into another lobby, where another branch of the guild would kill them there as well, until they just gave up and left the game.
