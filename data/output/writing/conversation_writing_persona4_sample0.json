    "Original Sample": "*The camera focuses in on Dwight, who pushes his glasses up on his nose while reading the paper in his hands. *    I've been hired to teach German to refugees in Germany. That means destitute people from other war-torn and destroyed countries will be in the same room as me to learn German.    *The scene cuts to an interview with Dwight. *    Well, I do n't know about anyone else, but the only war I know of that's been going on is the one over in Iraq. No other place has been destroyed in the past 5 years as much as that one. Therefore, I've accepted this job offer to have the chance to catch a terrorist and interrogate him for his secrets on the Taliban.    *While Dwight continues talking, the camera cuts to him opening his suitcase to reveal a hidden stash of  interrogatory  tools. He then pulls them out and brandishes or showcases them and how they work, accidentally throwing a wrench into the wall in front of him in an attempt to show how he would swing it. *    Once I get the secrets, I'll pass them on to the Secretary of Defense, be showered in praise as the man who saved America and become a legend just like my great grandfather, Dweide Schrute, to be written down in history as one of the greatest minds and men of my time.    *After all of this, cut back to Dwight's interview, where he's nodding and grinning. Then, after an awkwardly long pause : *    Unless the terrorist manages to convince me that the Taliban are actually correct, and that we are the terrorists. I do n't take sides because that's not how Schrutes have traditionally viewed fights between two parties. We listen to both sides of the argument, decide which one is best, and then fight with that side.    *Cut to commercial. *   _______  Maybe I put too much emphasis on the family part. I do n't really know. I'm just kinda saying what I think he would say...  ",
