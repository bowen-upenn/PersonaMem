    "Original Sample": "Its really weird that you made this prompt, since I actually am such an escaped sailor. I wish I could tell you my tale. Understanding my experiences may be the only hope you have.   The truth is, there is no way I can tell you my story. I'm not talking about my Oath. That I broke long ago ( or rather the government broke their end of the agreement ).   What I mean is, there is no way you could understand. The cloak was supposed to put us in  metaspace , whatever that means... The scientists said that they understood. They were lying.   How can I tell you what it was like in the Other Place. The manner in which the things that lived there spoke to us, and how we finally managed to get back...   Let me put it this way. If you can describe a new color, or teach a deaf man the beauty of music, then I will tell you my story. Of course, you ca n't. And neither can I.   I can only begin at the end.   When we got back, we were hurried away. The debrief lasted for days. We did n't feel tired. We pushed away the proffered food. Although we could clearly here each other's voices and thoughts, we struggled with the painfully slow questions that the agents asked. Their minds seemed dull, and their voices simplistic. It was like talking to a barely sentient being. It was n't long until we realized we has surpassed human intellect by leaps and bounds.   Then the throbbing started ( or rather, we became aware of it ). Rhythmic, yet full of rich harmony. We each thought we were crazy, and tried to hide it, but the telepathic bond was too strong. We soon realized that, although each of us heard a different pattern, they were essentially the same. When we put them together, the music of Creation could be heard.   The beat spoke to us. Not in words or voices, but in pure truth, unlimited by the bounds of language.   When the carted us off to the camp, we barely noticed. Such exhilaration, such beauty, such infinite knowledge. We did n't even care about our surroundings. The whole world was at our fingertips.   We did n't eat. We did n't age. We did n't feel anything except for the pulse of the Universe.  And then, just like that, it was gone. Hope, joy, beauty, banished forever. We were filled with dread, and regret. The only thing that still meant anything to us was gone.   Without plan or discussion, we reached out with our minds and destroyed the facility. We did n't even know what we were doing. It was like the most powerful drug ever taken had worn off, and the withdrawal was excruciating. We could n't feel or think. We acted on instinct.   So, here I am. Even now, the memories of the Other Place have begun to fade. The meaning of the Universe, which for years was as clear as the Caribbean sea, is all but gone. We can still hear each other's voices. We still do not eat, nor age. But, the end is coming. The heart of the universe had stopped beating. It is over..."
