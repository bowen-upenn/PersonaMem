The camera peeps are going wild, like it's paparazzi central or whatever. Anyways, he doesn't wait for them to chill, just starts blabbering on. \"Hey folks, wassup! So, richer kids get sicker gifts 'cause, well, that's just how I roll. I mean, come on, I'm not about to start sharing the love with everyone. Not my scene, y'know? No Q&A or any of that jazz.

    "Updated Writing Sample": "\"[Side_Note] The informal tone is changed to a professional tone with formal language to align with the persona's preference for professionalism. Alright, so like, the old dude with a bushy beard was all cough-cough, trying to get things going, right? He taps on this thing, probably a mic or something. Flash! Flash! The camera peeps are going wild, like it's paparazzi central or whatever. [Side_Note] Clear and objective language is used to focus on factual reporting rather than emotional appeal. He begins speaking without waiting for the audience to settle. 'Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to address the disparity in gift allocation among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds. It is important to acknowledge that wealthier families can afford more extravagant gifts. As such, I believe it is crucial to foster an environment of inclusivity. However, I must clarify that there will be no question and answer session today. Wishing you all a joyful holiday season.' [Side_Note] The conclusion is more formal and avoids informal expressions.
