    "Updated Writing Sample": "```plaintext\nNo one was really surprised when they heard that Humpty had fallen from the wall. [Side_Note: Adding historical context] For centuries, the wall had been the scene of many bizarre occurrences, but nothing quite like this. We all knew it was no accident. That weird little egg man was as annoying as they come. He was always telling really bad jokes, or yolks as he liked to call them. And given the chance he would follow you around all day poking and prodding you, claiming it was for science. But no one was brave enough to stand up to him because he was the King's nephew. And King Albumen was somewhat oblivious to his nephew's moronic nature. [Side_Note: Eccentric tone] Alas, today was a day of celebration for us mere mortals in the kingdom, as the news of Humpty's great fall spread. Humpty had been pushed from his favourite wall and cracked open. As far as the King was concerned, he had fallen and no one was going to correct him. As Chief of Royal Investigations, I was tasked with reaching the scene first in order to determine whether or not it truly was an accident. [Side_Note: Quirky subsection] Of Eggshells and Eccentrics: My Journey Begins. I was eager to oblige. For I knew that if all the pieces of Humpty's shell could be found then the same magic that made him a freaky little egg would heal him. As I approached the scene I was careful to check there was nobody around. I stared into the wreckage. I saw a small piece of shell, no bigger than a fingernail. I picked it up and put it in my pocket. As loyal as I was to King Albumen, this was not something I could let happen. Humpty must not be reconstructed. He was a menace and cost the city thousands a week in broken merchandise and psychiatric treatment for those he terrorised. [Side_Note: Playful valence] Oh, the joy of a city rid of its foul yolker! Having removed a piece of shell I set to work looking for any clues that this was not an accident. I did not want to see anyone punished for this but if there were any clear signs of malicious activity then I would have to or the King would hand my head. [Side_Note: Varying paragraph length] The pressure was mounting... As I continued my investigation, the medical team arrived and began their attempts to put Humpty together again. [Side_Note: Introspective and expressive tone] I pondered their efforts with mild amusement and tapped my pocket to make sure the piece was still there. My investigation yielded nothing. Whoever had done this was a professional. It must have been planned out carefully. I suspected it was an inside job but that meant nothing to me. Whoever it was was a hero in my eyes. [Side_Note: Colorful closing] I bid farewell to the scene, grinning at the thought of Humpty's eternal rest, and informed the king it had been an accident. I informed the medical team of where I was going and left them to their futile efforts. As I headed back to the castle I realised I would have to dispose of the shell before I faced the king. I came to a bridge that crossed the river the city had been built over. I scanned my surroundings. I couldn't see anyone. I took the shell from my pocket. I laid it on the wall for a moment. [Side_Note: Using dramatic pauses] The air was still. Then I picked up a loose stone and crushed into hundreds of tiny pieces. I brushed them into the river. [Side_Note: Expressive valence] A smile crept upon my face. I felt free as I continued to walk up to the castle. A large weight had been lifted from the city. My city.\n```",
