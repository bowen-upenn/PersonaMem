    "Original Sample": " Name?  The man at the desk sighed, monotone. He continued writing on one of the many forms in front of him without looking up at me.    Furcht. Richard Furcht.  I replied hesitantly. I rubbed at my wrist for a moment, where my watch had sat for years. Coughing weakly, I glanced around. The drab, gray walls of the facility were all too familiar too me. I shuddered, and dispelled the memories of my past.    Heritage?  The man opened a small drawer on his side of the glass and yawned. I glanced at the clock. *Four in the afternoon. *    None of significance.  I replied with false confidence.   He nodded slightly, as though this was what he had expected. He pulled a small block out of the drawer and stamped the form, glancing up at me. He sized me up for a moment, narrowing his eyes, as though in recognition. For a moment, I could not breath, and the sounds of the registration office quieted in the face of my fear. Time seemed to slow. At last, he closed his eyes and shook his head, silently chiding himself for such a ridiculous thought.  Ability?    I let my breath out slowly, relieved. I gave him a small, strained smile and answered my rehearsed response.  Tier Zero flight.    He chuckled.  You drew the short straw, huh?  He filled in a few more boxes on form and placed it onto a scanner on his desk. After a moment, he handed me it, along with my identification card.  There you go. You know the drill. Only use your powers in designated practice areas or when acting under the authority of the Integrated Armed Forces. Should the IAF require your presence, they will contact you via the methods you provided on your identification card.  He smirked, giving me a knowing wink.  Not that you will be worrying about that, huh?    I chuckled in return, surprised at how natural the laugh sounded. I gave the man a small wave, took my forms, and walked through the doorway to the man's left. Behind me, I heard a woman muttering something that sounded suspiciously like'Finally.' If only this were a less public location.   -- -   One walk through an abnormally long hallway later, I finally reached the end, where my team was gathered. Seeing them, I smiled broadly and easily for the first time since I entered the facility.  Richard! Thank the Gods.  Sarah McGregor, a Tier Five fire manipulator, and ironically the member of our team most worried about safety.    Seriously, Sarah?  Joseph Torres, Tier Seven flight.  You honestly think that the IAF is anywhere *near* capable enough to catch Furcht?  He scoffed with a teasing grin in his eyes.    Careful, Flight Risk.  I smirked as I used his old nickname, knowing his reaction to it.  That almost sounded like a compliment. If I did n't know any better, I'd say you're finally starting to like me.    He rolled his eyes and the three of us walked away from the facility, bantering.   -- -   At last, we reached the apartment that Sarah had gotten us with the reserve funds we stashed for a rainy day. As we entered, I glanced around approvingly.  I can work with this.    Sarah and Joseph glanced at each other nervously, and I narrowed my eyes. Instead of asking, I simply crossed my arms and waited, knowing they were going to tell me either way.    We're leaving the fight, Richard.  Sarah said at last with a sigh.  We ca n't take it anymore.  Joseph nodded in support.   I closed my eyes softly and breathed deeply.  How long have you been thinking about this?  I asked calmly as I opened them once more, disguising my inner rage.    It's... Not a recent development.  Joseph said quietly, avoiding my gaze.    Since Manhattan.  I deadpanned, looking between the two of them as they winced.  I'm right, then. You've wanted to leave since Manhattan.     Do you know how many people died, Richard?  Sarah looked into my eyes, trying to find some hint of pity for those that died on that day.  The IAF has every right to hate us after... After *that*.    I dropped the facade of calmness, allowing some small portion of my inner rage to show.  Two hundred seventy-three thousand, five hundred and forty-eight.  I replied, walking forward slowly.  I know exactly how many people died, but do you want to know what else I know?    I was now directly in front of the expert fire manipulator.  I am *not* the one at fault.  I scowled.  No matter what the IAF thinks. No matter what the Resistance thought, before the IAF wiped them out. No matter what you think. Everything that happened that day? That's on them. On their conscience. Not mine.  I pushed passed the two of them, walking out. I needed to breathe.   -- -   *Seven Years Before*    Richard Gewalt! Come out with your hands above your head!  The IAF announced their presence, as they always do, with the blare of a siren and the agonizing noise of a megaphone.    Are you sure, Sarah?  I frowned as I placed my hand on her shoulder. A jolt went through both of us.   Fire began to erupt in each of her hands. She closed her eyes, and it began to grow.  Let's do this.  She said coldly, crossing her arms in front of her. In that instant, the flames exploded outwards, consuming everything in their path, everything except us.   -- -   My name is Richard Gewalt, Tier Ten power amplified, and I will destroy the IAF, even if I have to do by my damned self.   -- -   To be continued? Maybe.",
