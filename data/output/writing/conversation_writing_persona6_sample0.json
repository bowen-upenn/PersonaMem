    "Original Sample": "Queen Elsa of Aryndelle also known as Elsa the Mad was the First Consul of Prussia from 1341-1367. She rose to power in 1338 in her small county of Aryndelle. During the night of her coronation, she murdered her sister, Auna and her fianc\u00e9. Her guards were then ordered to kill everyone else. At least 8 monarchs were killed in this bloodbath, including the Queen of Sweden, Rapunzel. She then began a militaristic conquest and united all of Prussia ( modern-day Germany ) ruling with an Iron Fist and burning villages to the ground if they did not cooperate. Almost like some German Nero or something. Her empire had expanded until southern Ireland and half of Russia. Which she conquered during the winter. It is speculated that she was assassinated by a man named Kristoff, an ice merchant who went bankrupt due to unfair taxation.",
