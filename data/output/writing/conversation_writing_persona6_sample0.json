    "Original Sample": "Sure, here's the rewritten sample: \n\nHuman contact wasn\u2019t something Ender particularly felt like dealing with anymore. The house next to the lake was really more than just an aesthetically pleasing escape from his training, but really it had kind of turned into a fortress where nothing from the outside world could really penetrate or exist. It was a real problem. \u201cThese aren\u2019t the results we were expecting\u201d said the Polemarch\u2019s voice in Graff\u2019s head \u201cwe can\u2019t trust the fate of our whole species to an asset that\u2019s basically broken, unfortunately we haven\u2019t got any other options available. Fix it somehow.\u201d Graff thought about how this whole thing might go. Ender was smart - way too smart for the usual stuff. Valentine might be a possible option, but seeing her might push him over the edge or something. Plus, even getting her to cooperate might be impossible. \u201cHe already resents us for what we did to him; I mean really, I wouldn\u2019t blame him\u201d Graff said aloud. \u201cI\u2019m so close to hating us for this.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t go soft now Graff,\u201d Mazer said \u201cEverything we\u2019ve done has been necessary. Wiggan may be clever, but in the end, he\u2019s still a ten-year-old kid. He\u2019s got the desires and needs you\u2019d expect from a ten-year-old kid, and the experience level of one too. We can get him out of this.\u201d \u201cSo what are you thinking,\u201d Graff replied \u201cthat we need to treat him like any ordinary child? That\u2019ll never work, he\u2019ll see through it instantly\u201d \u201cThen we don\u2019t bother hiding it.\u201d Mazer said \u201cA placebo can work sometimes even when the person knows it\u2019s a placebo. Probably what he needs is to be treated exactly as he is, a typical all-American boy who\u2019s ten.\u201d   \u201cWhat\u2019s this supposed to be, some kind of joke?\u201d Ender said Graff was standing at the door, holding a leash with a small brown puppy excitedly pulling on it trying to get to Ender. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a joke Ender, it\u2019s a dog. More specifically, it\u2019s your dog.\u201d Graff said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting sloppy, sir, this is far too obvious.\u201d Ender went to the window, looked once at the puppy which was now fascinated with its tail. \u201cSloppy?\u201d \u201cThis is clearly an attempt to provoke an emotional response, obviously you\u2019re not happy with how I turned out so you\u2019re trying to manipulate me through my instincts. This won\u2019t work.\u201d \u201cYou know, most kids your age would be excited to be given a dog of their own.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not like most kids\u2026 I thought that was the main reason for all this.\u201d \u201cEnder, I would enjoy a back-and-forth with you now, but I can\u2019t afford the time. Whether you like it or not, it\u2019s yours. Consider it a reward or an assignment or a punishment. Whichever.\u201d Graff went over, took his hand, pushed the leash in and started to leave. Ender had just enough time to close his hand and prevent the dog from following him. He looked down, into big brown eyes staring back, with its mouth open, tongue out and panting. \u201cIt\u2019s a mutt, very clever sir, but I thought you would\u2019ve gotten something better. Maybe a three-legged one?\u201d Ender knelt down to look at it, his hand started unconsciously toward the dog\u2019s right ear. \u201cInterpret it any way you like Ender, it\u2019s something you\u2019ll just have to deal with\u201d Graff said leaving the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s its name?\u201d Ender asked Graff\u2019s voice was faint now despite his volume, he was leaving quickly. Hannibal was a different kind of name, but Rex or Fido were too clich\u00e9, and Steve was dull. Ender was sure if he played along at all it would be on his terms. This was a decent dog as far as Ender could tell, though his family never had one despite Peter\u2019s relentless requests at age six. He was sure there was some pit-bull there, but not much. Likely 1/16th. Mainly comprised of Shepherds, probably both German and Australian because of how it was always running. Maybe some retriever, hence the blonde and brown coat and pointed nose. Ender's dog training knowledge was limited, but most available vids from the IF net were military and police related. Instead of just creating an obedient companion, Ender started exploring techniques through his own ideas. Basic stuff was sorted in some weeks. Positive reinforcement and strict expectations took care of that. After what felt like a short period of time, Hannibal could do the usual commands like sit, stay, heel, roll over, and fetch like any other dog. Hannibal always stayed by Ender\u2019s right side through all the turns he made. He\u2019d sleep at the foot of the bed, never moving, then in the morning Hannibal fetched some slippers before obstacle course stuff. But this was just a start. They wanted to manipulate him, so he\u2019d prove manipulation back. Hannibal ended up a test subject. Ender wanted to see just how much he could derive from that dog\u2019s head. Color perception was out - dogs can\u2019t see red, but shapes and basic problems were remaining avenues. Ender  tried additions to the course made. Simple signs to dictate turns. Later, basic patterns when Hannibal understood. The dog wasn't exceptionally bright, but his eagerness to please and hours of effort showed. Graff kept this in mind and reported to the Polemarch, noting how little Ender spent just playing with the dog informally. Everything was very regimented. \u201cHeck, he doesn\u2019t even walk the thing, treats it like any soldier.\u201d Graff said. \u201cIt\u2019s more like a weapon\u201d Mazer added \u201cdoesn\u2019t even train anyone in his army the way he does that dog. It\u2019s really cold. Unfortunately it seems we\u2019re done. Wiggan might be completely broken.\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t exhausted our options.\u201d Graff said, oddly upbeat. \u201cI just got some interesting news regarding who Demosthenes really is.\u201d",
