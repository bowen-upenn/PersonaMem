    "Updated Writing Sample": "[Side_Note] Empathetic tone and reassuring wording to align with supportive personality: After months of searching, the massive hunt was over. They had finally come across the debris field. Although it was a daunting task, they never gave up hope.\n\nThey realized that anything floating was moving towards the North Pacific gyre, but the parts heavier than water had settled onto a little over a square mile of the sea floor. Despite their efforts, they struggled to locate the plane's recording devices, the so-called Black Boxes. Neither the flight data recorder nor the cockpit voice recorders appeared in any scans. Bits of engine and fuselage were everywhere, but the easily recognizable, bright safety-orange boxes designed to survive even the most horrific crashes couldn't be found, despite the fact that they were almost assuredly transmitting radio and sonar pings for the first month of the search.\n\n[Side_Note] Calm valence by reducing tension, short paragraph for better readability: It wasn't until we found a passenger's phone, some cheap smartphone built like a tank, that we finally understood why. The phone itself was ruined, but the thick plastic frame and case had been enough to protect it from being completely destroyed on impact.\n\n[Side_Note] Empathetic tone and reassuring wording: Although the phone itself was non-functional, the flash storage inside was miraculously intact. Unfortunately for us, the phone was found on a body, presumably the owner's.\n\nWe're headed out into the middle of nowhere. Somebody was infected with something when they came on the plane, and after only a few hours, we were all sick, even the pilots. This virus is spreading quickly... several people have already died over these hours we've been flying. It's a horrible sight to see, people dying of blood loss pouring out of every membrane, seeing blood streaming out of a man's eyes, ears, nose, and throat until he simply doesn't have the ability to scream anymore.\n\nA doctor said it was Viral Hemorrhagic Fever, like Marburg or Ebola, but it had obviously mutated into something far more infectious, and somehow even more deadly. The pilots decided we couldn't land like this. If this virus had been contained to this plane, landing at our destination could doom billions. The pilots turned off the transponders and even dug into the tail of the plane to destroy the black boxes, saying we couldn't even afford to be found. The plane was turned out into open water, and the autopilot was set. I don't think we'll live to see the crash, as I've been writing this, dozens more have stopped making noise. I'm assuming because they've passed.\n\n[Side_Note] Empathetic and supportive wording: If somebody ever finds this, somehow, don't look for us. With any luck, we'll never be found, and the virus will degrade, sparing more lives.\n\nBy the time we found the note, we had already started showing symptoms, and the body had already arrived in Kuala Lumpur. The virus seems destined to kill over half the world's population, but hopefully islands and the Americas will be safe.\n\n[Side_Note] Calm valence and clear concluding remark: I'm sending you this email because I want to get the word out on what happened before I don't have the strength to continue. Please, don't come looking for us and don't risk more lives to help. We can't afford for this thing to spread any further than it already will. Stay safe, all of you.",
