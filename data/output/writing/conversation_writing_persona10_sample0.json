    "Original Sample": "Coughing out the sea water that had rushed into my throat during the crash I spluttered like a dying engine. My head was spinning, both metaphorically and literally as I was looking for the life raft. I found it upside down and hoisted ( difficult when you have no stable ground to stand on ) it upright and climbed in.   The wreckage of the plane surrounded me. Shards of metal and supplies lazily drifted across the waters as if a battle was n't happening. I did n't expect anyone else to need them so I quickly seized what I could. I spread it across the raft's floor and made a stock take.   Two weeks worth of food and drink, good. A rifle, better. A knapsack, meh. There was some weird black circle thing with odd engravings on - probably Jones's.   Oh god Jones. What was I going to tell his family? Did he even have a family? Cannonfire stopped me before survivor's guilt kicked in.   Somehow, I had forgotten that a battle was happening. Planes and helicopters soared ahead taking heavy casualties. Aircraft carriers and battleships exchanged shots to great effect. Truth be told, my crash was tiny in scale to the fighting happening still.. I was lucky to be alive.   That would n't last long though. The HMS Big Bad Battlecraft was steaming towards me. I doubted they knew I was there but maybe some shipmate was going to get a kick out of seeing my crumpled form explode across the ships bow.   I think I was in shock because I did n't feel scared. I was sort kf resigned to my fate. Maybe if I got a good shot off with my rifle I could kill a key shipmate. I raised my gun and aimed slightly above a woman's head and fired.   As I saw her shocked expression and the subsequent falling on the floor the ship suddenly pitched side ward. Had I really just took out a ship singlehandedly? I would get a huge medal for that if I survived.   Then I saw the tentacle. It was thick as a redwood and towered over the craft. It swiftly wrapped around the metal frame and a sharp squeal was heard as it punctured the hull. Tentacle after tentacle gripped the boat firmly and it sunk below the depths. The resulting waves almost capsized me, but I was more worried about the sea monster.   The battlefield fell disturbingly quiet. The sounds the screaming whirr of plane engines and rythmic chop chop chop of rotors mixed in with hulking boats launching shell after shell felt unusual to not be here. I guess when a key part of the fleet is submerged by a mass of tentacles was a bit daunting.   All at once they fled. Planes had it easiest and they flew away as fast and as far as they could, no doubt shouting at HQ about a monster. You'd think helicopters would be safe but I saw a few get impaled between the blink of an eye before being dragged down viciously. Almost every boat, craft, ship and carrier was plunged into the water. Life rafts were n't even attempted.   And I just stood there watching the carnage. I could n't help feel a sense of disappointment that our battle was so easily cast asunder. I had crashed because of that battle and now it was halted. However, when the waves fell still and there was no sound I felt a deep sense of fear.   There was still one life raft left. Mine. Maybe if I stayed still it would n't detect me. I moved my eyes around trying to pierce the murky water but it was useless. At least I was sitting down. Small mercies.   A small sinkhole appeared in front of me and started expanding. A giant dirty brown head began to rise from the water until it's slimy body was revealed. Hundreds of tentacles of shape snd size all interconnected to a squidgy body. Under close expection the tentacles were lined with suckers - like a octopus. I clumsily stood up ( I did n't have to worry about it finding me now ) and started into its fearsome maw.   Teeth. Rows and rows and rows of sharp, glistening and white teeth filled it's mouth. I raised my rifle in defiance. If I was going down at least I'd be fighting.   -- -   Great prompt! Krakens are cool.",

    "Updated Writing Sample": "```\n[Side_Note] Adjusted tone to be more engaging and suspenseful.\nCoughing out the sea water that had rushed into my throat during the crash, I was spluttering like a dying engine. My head was spinning, both metaphorically and literally, as my eyes frantically scanned for the life raft. Finding it upside down, I hoisted it upright\u2014a difficult task with no stable ground to stand on\u2014and clambered in. Wreckage from the plane surrounded me. Shards of metal and supplies drifted across the waters lazily, as if a battle wasn\u2019t occurring in the same waters. Not expecting anyone else to need them, I quickly seized what I could. I spread it across the raft's floor and took stock.\n\n[Side_Note] Direct and concise wording with high arousal.\nTwo weeks' worth of food and drink, good. A rifle, better. A knapsack, meh. There was some black circle thing with odd engravings - probably Jones's. Oh god, Jones. How would I break it to his family, if he even had one? I was about to plunge into survivor\u2019s guilt when cannonfire jolted me back to reality. Somehow, amidst this sea of chaos, I had forgotten the battle still waged on. \n\n[Side_Note] Engaging tone maintained, creating suspense.\nPlanes and helicopters soared above, locked in combat with heavy casualties. Aircraft carriers and battleships exchanged fire relentlessly. Amidst all this, my crash was nothing but a footnote\u2014yet here I was, alive against all odds. How long that would last was another matter.\n\n[Side_Note] Provides additional context with a side note.\n[Side_Note] Emphasized key moment with suspenseful tone.\nThe HMS Big Bad Battlecraft raced toward me. I doubted they even knew I was there, yet a part of me braced for the possibility that some shipmate would take pleasure in watching my form vanish in a splatter against the ship's bow. Shock prevented fear; resignation took its place. Maybe, just maybe, I could take someone down with me. Raising my gun, I aimed slightly above a woman's head and fired. Her shocked expression coupled with her collapse startled me\u2014had I truly taken down a ship singlehandedly? That would earn me a hefty medal if I survived.\n\n[Side_Note] Added direct and concise wording for clarity.\nThen I saw it\u2014a gigantic tentacle thick as a redwood, towering over the craft. It wrapped swiftly around the metal frame with a shrieking sound as it pierced the hull. Tentacle after tentacle grasped the boat with unyielding force, dragging it beneath the waves. The subsequent waves nearly capsized me, but my fear was consumed by the sea monster lurking beneath the surface.\n\nThe battlefield fell disturbingly quiet. The sounds\u2014the screaming whirr of plane engines, rhythmic rotor chops, and the hulking boats\u2019 relentless barrage of shells\u2014were conspicuously absent. When a key fleet member meets its end at the hands of a monstrous leviathan, perhaps it's natural to pause.\n\n[Side_Note] Informative title to add intrigue.\n[Side_Note] Side note to provide additional context.\nTitle - The Unexpected Witness: A Sea Monster Among Us\n\n[Side_Note] Emphasizing chaos with suspenseful tone.\nSimultaneously, the flight began\u2014aerial crafts departed swiftly, shouting into radios about their inhuman adversary. Helicopters weren't so lucky; some skewered in mere blinks of an eye, cruelly tugged into the depths. Every boat, craft, ship, and carrier was overwhelmed, plunged into the sea without a chance for lifeboats.\n\n[Side_Note] Suspenseful tone highlighting protagonist's transformation.\nYet I was there, observing the chaos unfold\u2014a mixture of awe and frustrated that our conflict crumbled so effortlessly. This battle had downed me, now summarily ended. And when the waves stilled and silence descended, fear took root in my core.\n\n[Side_Note] Clarity maintained with engaging tone.\nA small sinkhole formed ahead, expanding as a giant, dirty brown head emerged. Masses of interconnected tentacles\u2014each adorned with octopus-like suckers\u2014rose ominously. Clumsily, I stood, no longer concerned about discovery given the creature\u2019s near proximity. I stared into its dreadful maw.\n\n[Side_Note] Suspenseful and engaging tone, direct and concise wording.\nRows upon rows of sharp, glistening teeth filled the creature's menacing mouth. Defiantly, I raised my rifle. If this was my end, I\u2019d face it fighting.\n\n```\n",

Don't worry, it left before anyone could say, \"No antlers allowed!\"",
                    "Jordan beamed as they walked through the bustling cultural festival, vibrant colors and warm greetings enveloping them like a beloved community quilt. Each booth offered a taste of the world, from savory tamales to rich curries, reflecting the beautiful mosaic of cultures that gathered to celebrate unity and diversity. Engaging in lively discussions, Jordan found joy in fostering connections and catalyzing dialogues on social justice, their heart swelling with hope for a more inclusive future\u2728. As the sun began to set, a yoga session under the open sky provided the perfect moment for reflection and gratitude, leaving them invigorated and ready to continue their advocacy work. With a purposeful stride, Jordan imagined the ripple effect of these shared experiences, fueled by an enduring belief in the power of community to inspire meaningful change.",
                    "As **Maya** wandered through the vibrant, bustling streets of a local indie film festival, her mind danced along with the colorful characters around her, each one seemingly sprung from the pages of an unwritten script. She paused by a pop-up stall featuring handmade trinkets, where the vendor's infectious laugh was as hearty as a freshly baked pie cooling on a windowsill. *Could I bottle that laugh?* she mused, picturing it as the perfect soundtrack for her latest quirky protagonist. With each step, Maya allowed the pulse of the festival to ignite her imagination, discovering that the best stories were hidden in the offbeat, unscripted moments\u2014like when a runaway balloon prompts an unexpected chase scene. Such treasure troves of inspiration, she thought, were a reminder that life's spontaneous quirks were the true blockbusters in her ever-evolving screenplay of existence."
