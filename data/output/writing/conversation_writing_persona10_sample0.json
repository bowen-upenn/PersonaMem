Anyway, Chuck's all \"Bruises would be less scary,\" but Dave likes blood more. I mean, come on, a bruise in your brain? Whatever. Chuck's blabbing about orange-blood juice (seriously?) and Dave's out of it. Moving on, people are vanishing, and then bam, new gangsters walking around. This lady Mary with ugly hair and fake boobs \u2013 she's gone and now a black teenager with the same dumb bun. Freaky, right? Way they talk, it's like Detroit exploded into the world, turning everywhere into little Detroits \u2013 'Planet Detroit,' no less. Florida's a mess now \u2013 it's the main hangout for the red-shirt crew. Chuck blames it all on a 'Big Gang Bang' he missed. Haha, Dave's bummed he wasn't there. This Woodstock nap d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. ",
