    "Updated Writing Sample": "The girl couldn't have been more than 12, and was probably very surprised to find me in a library. I could tell she had started debating whether she should walk up to me or not a good fifteen minutes before she actually did it. She would keep returning to nearby shelves, not really looking at the books. [Side_Note: Adding subsections and clearer headers/title for better structuring.] When she realized she was in the adults' section, she turned redder than any tomato I've ever seen and didn't return for five minutes. Then she finally worked up the courage. \n\n---\n\n\"I love your show,\" she said, carefully keeping eye contact. I was impressed.\n\n[Side_Note: Preferring informative wording and professionalism by quoting direct speech clearly.] \"Do you, now? It's mostly for older kids, you know.\"  \n\n\"I watch it with my brother when mom's away.\" She frowned. \"He says I don't 'get' it. But I do.\"  \n\n\"You must be a smart girl, then.\" I gave her what I hoped was an honest smile.  \n\n\"Could I maybe have an autograph? Please.\"\n\n[Side_Note: Emphasizing a professional tone and honesty in interactions.] \"Of course. What's your name? Lucy? With a 'c', right? There you go.\"  \n\n\"Thank you so much!\"  \n\n\"And tell your brother to cut you some slack for me, right? 'Science is for everyone'!\" I did the trademark wink and everything.   \n\n[Side_Note: Maintaining a professional tone with a neutral valence, aligning with analytical personality.] Robert waited a few seconds before saying anything, and then, with his crooked nose still in his book about conspiracies in the '80s, muttered: \"You shouldn't do that, you know.\"  \n\n\"Yeah? What do you want me to do?\" My chest swelled up. \"Crush her heart, tell her I'm busy?\"  \n\nRobert faced me now, his big bushy eyebrows shadowing his eyes. \"I don't know, be honest?\"  \n\n\"What, should I tell her my brother's an anti-social freak, hiding from the world in his big mansion, refusing anyone but whores? At least this way her role model is still an okay guy.\"  \n\n\"Either way, little Lucy will be pretty confused when her brother tells her the show was recorded 20 years ago.\"   \n\n\"Come on, let's go grab lunch. I don't feel like reading.\"   \n\n[Side_Note: Adding bullet points for clarity in action descriptions.] Robert looked down at my untouched book, some garbage about space travel, burying his eyes even deeper under those brows.\n\n   - \"You have 15 more hours of reading to do this month. It's the 26th. Of February.\"   \n   - \"What, you going to tell on me?\"  \n   - \"It's my job.\" He tried so hard to be stern.   \n\n\"I'll buy you a burger. Come on. I'm only secondarily your science project. Primarily, I'm hungry.\"   \n\n[Side_Note: Clear separation with bullet points for conversational flow.] \n\n   - \"You're not my science project. And I'm only secondarily your custodian, I'm primarily your friend. And you know by Thursday, slacking off is not going to be worth it.\" He did grab his jacket, though.   \n   - \"I'll take the book with me, if it makes you feel better.\"   \n   - \"It does. I can't keep covering for you forever.\"   \n   - \"Yeah, yeah.\" I was already on my way to the front desk.   \n\nThe woman at the front desk had exactly the sleek hair and thin glasses you'd expect from a librarian. But her lipstick was hastily put on and kind of smeared.\n\n[Side_Note: Maintaining professional tone and consistency in names formatting.] \n\n\"Mr. McGillian?\" she asked. \n\n\"Uh.\" I glanced to the side. The god-damned girl was at the front desk as well. \"Sure,\" I said.   \n\n\"You've yet to return the last book you loaned.\"   \n\n\"I... what?\" Robert came up to my side. \"What book was that, again?\"  \n\n\"On human cloning. There will be a penalty charge unless we have it back by Thursday.\"   \n\nMe and Robert just stared at each other.",
