    "Original Sample": "Moira wanted to talk about how she burns super easy, like really easy, you know. So, she kinda moved back and banged into her desk which was like right in the sun, ouch! That was hot, for real. She jerked forward like whoa, didn't expect that! She leaned on her desk but tried to dodge the light this time, glancing at her boss who had this weird look, you know, like what was he thinking? Moira was all, trying to act like everything was cool. So, yeah, it\u2019s such a nice day but, OMG, she was busy and all. She pointed at the mountain of papers like, seriously, this was reason enough to stay inside, right? Her boss was like, \"Moira, it\u2019s called time off! This stuff can chill \u2018til next week, right? Girl, you need to chill and have fun outside, you can\u2019t be working 24/7 or whatever.\" Moira was like \"Oh, yes I can, sir,\" fixing her coat and all, being all defiant. Woohoo, nailed it. Her boss threw that suspicious gaze her way again. Like, was he onto something? He was all, \"At least open the blinds, come on! Sunshine in Alaska is like, whoa, rare!\" Moira was mentally screaming, no way! \"Oh, nope sir, that\u2019s cool, for real. I hate screen glare, you feel me?\" She was mentally high-fiving herself for the smart comeback like wow. He was just standing there all confused and was like, \"Chill sometimes, would hate for you to burn out.\" Burnout? Like, seriously, what does he mean? Moira laughs, kinda nervous-like, \"Oh yeah, that's def the last thing we want, haha, right?\" And off he goes, shutting the door. Strange vibes about Moira, totally. Workaholics, sure, but she was a next-level case. He\u2019s gotta keep an eye on her. Alone again, Moira let out this gigantic sigh while messing with the blinds again. Wow, this was intense, and she thought, *he\u2019s figuring it out, gotta keep tabs on him too, for real.*",

    "Updated Writing Sample": "[Side_Note] This opening sentence is too casual and vague; it can be made more concise and clear. Moira wanted to discuss her sensitivity to sun exposure, as it impacts her daily activities. [Side_Note] \"Kinda\" is informal and not precise. So, she moved back and accidentally bumped into her desk, which was positioned in direct sunlight. [Side_Note] The expression \"ouch!\" is overly casual; instead, I will state the consequence directly. That was an uncomfortable experience due to the heat. She jerked forward unexpectedly; she didn\u2019t anticipate that reaction. [Side_Note] The phrase \"like whoa\" is informal and not appropriate for this tone. She leaned on her desk but attempted to avoid the sunlight this time, glancing at her boss, who appeared to be observing her intently. [Side_Note] \"Weird look\" is vague; it's better to describe it objectively. Moira was attempting to maintain her composure despite feeling uneasy. So, yes, it\u2019s a pleasant day, but she was occupied with work. She pointed at the stack of papers on her desk, indicating that this was sufficient reason to remain indoors, correct? Her boss replied, \"Moira, it\u2019s called time off! This stuff can wait until next week, right? You need to take a break and enjoy the outdoors; you can\u2019t work continuously.\" Moira responded, \"Oh, yes, I can, sir,\" adjusting her coat defiantly. [Side_Note] \"Woohoo, nailed it\" is informal and overly casual. Her boss shot her a skeptical look again. It was unclear if he suspected something. He insisted, \"At least open the blinds! Sunshine in Alaska is quite rare!\" Moira mentally resisted, stating, \"Oh, no, sir, that\u2019s not necessary. I dislike screen glare, if you understand.\" [Side_Note] \"High-fiving\" is too casual; this can be stated more formally. She mentally commended herself for her clever rebuttal. He stood there looking perplexed and said, \"Make sure to relax; I would hate for you to face burnout.\" Burnout? What did he mean by that? Moira chuckled nervously, responding, \"Oh yes, that is the last outcome we want, correct?\" And off he went, closing the door. [Side_Note] \"Strange vibes\" is informal and subjective; it can be stated more analytically. Her demeanor was undoubtedly that of a workaholic, but she was an extreme case. He likely needed to monitor her behavior. Alone again, Moira exhaled deeply while adjusting the blinds once more. This situation felt intense, and she thought, *he\u2019s beginning to understand; I must remain vigilant regarding his observations as well.*",
