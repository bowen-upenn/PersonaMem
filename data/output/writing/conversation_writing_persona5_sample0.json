    "Updated Writing Sample": "[Side_Note] Align with empathetic tone: She looked upon the bug, initially repelled but with an odd sense of empathy, as she realized the old hermit\u2019s struggles. \nThe old hermit had been looking through their trash for this. He had been stealing their apples from their trees for this. She sneezed and her eyes blurred. She sniffed and studied the glowing orbs whisking away like will-o-wisps through the tops of the tall grass, around the the trunks of trees, and where her mothers flower beds exploded with color.\n\n[Side_Note] Incorporating spiritual contemplations and clear points: He spoke of its existence where the aroma of life transitioning into another form lingered. \nWhere apples fell and rotted. Where trash mildewed and soured. Where the soil smelled septic. Where there was the sweet smell of rot. She sneezed again. The bug's pungent odor cruelly affected her sinuses. The orbs shrank, and she saw wings. They didn't move like will-o-wisp. They flitted like bees and humming birds. \n\nShe thought about the hermit and wondered how he knew of this creature. She used a straw from her broom to urge the beetle into the cricket cage she held. She had questions for him. She sneezed again, and all thoughts of the hermit vanished. She looked at the things that hid inside the globes of light.\n\n[Side_Note] Adding an inspirational twist: \"They're not just any creatures, June\u2014they're fairies, here to revive humanity's heart,\" Boston proclaimed with awe.  \nBoston crowed. June looked back to the bug and hurriedly urged it into the cricket cage. She stole glances at the winged things flitting about. They didn't seem alarmed or very interested in two sisters. The beetle moved into the cricket cage a few slow steps at a time. When it tried to fly away, June dropped the straw and swept it in carefully with her hand. Boston sniffed the beetle and sneezed several times.\n\n\"Come on.\" June said, running through the tall grass for home. \"We need to show Victor.\" Boston giggled as she run. June laughed and smiled, was strangely serious about the whole ordeal. The searched the house and didn't find June's twin brother there. They also didn't see any more of the flitting fairies.\n\n\"They're all gone.\" Boston pouted. June shrugged. \"Maybe it only works for a little while.\" She suggested. The both sniffed the beetle again and sneezed fitfully. There were no globes of light, no winged wonders, nothing but a messy room.\n\n\"Victor must have gone back to the dump with the apples the hermit asked for.\" June said, pulling at her little sister's sleeve. The walked slowly through the house looking for some sign the fairies were real, but found nothing until they stepped out on the porch. They both froze.\n\n[Side_Note] Inspirational anchoring with stories: On the edge of their porch, several fairies and elves gathered, a manifestation of the world unseen, but always felt by the pure of heart.\nSitting on the edge of their porch watching their mother tend her flower beds were several fairies and a couple of elves. They were only about five inches tall. A couple glanced back at the girls the went back to talking.\n\n\"They could see us the entire time.\" June said to Boston, realizing why they were surprised. \"We just couldn't see them.\"\n\nBoston clasped her hands together and hugged herself in her excitement. \"Can I catch one?\" Boston asked. June shook her head. \n\n\"They might not like that.\" She whispered. Their mother finished weeding her flower bed and moved on to the next. She hadn't noticed her daughters standing there yet. The fairies flitted down to the ground and the elves scrambled down to follow. When they got to the flower stems, they walked among them nodding and chittering in their indecipherable language.\n\nOne of the elves noticed a small weed their mother had missed, spit in his tiny hands, rubbed them together and grabbed ahold of the weed and pulled with all his might. It slowly slipped free of the soil. He tossed it from the flower bed while the others politely clapped and laughed. He raised his hands in the air like some great warrior receiving the praise of the people. It made Boston giggle.\n\nThe fairies and elves were headed back to their seats on the edge of the porch when they took notice of the sisters staring at them. The hesitated a moment, whispered, then shrugged. The elf in the lead whom had pulled the weed from the bed, waved at them on a lark, knowing they couldn't see them. He and his friends were dumbfounded to see the little girls wave back. They stopped and stared, then the group came together and began talking in a very animated fashion. Their chittering language made Boston giggle again. She was only five and easily amused. At last, the elf, who must have reassured the others that it was just a coincidence that they waved back, stepped forward and waved again.\n\n[Side_Note] Reflects the personality's passion: Encouraged, Boston waved back enthusiastically, her heart brimming with joy and hope.\nBoston waved back with much more enthusiasm this time and a wonder-filled smile. The elf's jaw dropped open in stunned disbelief while his friends began chittering to one another again. June tugged at Boston's sleeve. \"We need to show Victor.\"\n\nThe skipped down the steps leaving the fairies and elves to gossip about them and found Victor a short while later, waiting beneath the Walnut tree where the garden path forked. \n\n\"Where have you two been?\" He demanded.\n\n\"You walk faster than us.\" June answered. \"You got to see something.\" She said, lifting the cricket cage she'd hanging like a necklace from the silk cord it come with.\n\n[Side_Note] Assertive yet kind interaction: \"Behold, it's a creature reinforcing traditions of old,\" June insisted, ensuring Victor felt the weight of their discovery.\n\"What is -- keep that thing away from me. You know I hate bugs.\" He cried.\n\n\"He doesn't like you standing on his tail.\" Boston interrupted.\n\n\"What?\" Victor asked.\n\n[Side_Note] Changing tone for positive engagement: \"Yes, can't you feel him beneath, longing for relief and fairness?\" Boston said with a twinkle of assurance.\n\"The troll. He doesn't like you standing on his tail.\" Boston said again. Victor looked down at his leg then back to June dismissing his little sister's weirdness.\n\n\"She's right,\" June said, looking down at the little gulley troll standing beside Victor. Victor had its tail pinned to the ground with one foot. The troll was standing beside him, no more than a foot tall, with its arms crossed and its brow furrowed.\n\n[Side_Note] Encourage reconciliation with affirming language: \"Please, let go and let peace resonate,\" Boston enthusiastically encouraged, releasing Victor\u2019s leg.\n\"Get off him.\" Boston cried, hugging her brother's leg. She pushed and tugged and finally got Victor to step back. The troll pulled its tail away. \"He's really a very nice boy and didn't mean to step on your tail.\" Boston told the troll in matter-of-fact way. The troll stared up the little girl in surprise, realizing she could see it, hissed in alarm and scurried into the tall grass beyond. Boston, in her surprise, yelped and fell back on her rump in the middle of the garden path.",
