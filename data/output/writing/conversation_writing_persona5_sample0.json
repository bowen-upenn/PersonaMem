    "Original Sample": "I slipped through the heavy fog, it's wispy tendrils pulling at my skin like they were made out of toffee. The whole fog reminded me of toffee in more ways than that, in fact. The golden brown colour, the subtle scent in the air and the fact that if you looked closely you could still see some poor bugger's teeth still floating in its grasp. The land beyond the fog was n't oh so much better. Rolling hills of yellowed and brown grass and a drab grey sky that brought to mind countless tasteless soups from childhood. I felt lightheaded, the grey and brown vista melted before my eyes.   I woke to a sharp pain in my leg. Looking down I saw the thin and rough looking man who was biting it and shook him off roughly. He peered up at me from where he had fallen into his butt and gave me a hurt look.  If you still wanted it  he protested,  you should n't have left it there . I sat for a moment and contemplated his statement, before hitting him hard, quite squarely in the face. His leg tasted horrible and I gave up after barely a nibble. A large bird flew passed and circled round to land nearby.  You gon na eat that?  It asked, peering at the slumped man at my feet. I looked from the man to the bird. Both older than they had looked originally, though I could n't put my finger on how. The man's dirty clothes were obviously threadbare but were once a decent quality. The bird was orange I guessed, or at least it was once, now it was a washed-out off-cream colour that reminded me of a particularly drab hotel room I'd once stayed in.  Where are we?  I asked the bird, reflecting to myself the stupidity of the situation. The bird looked at me with a look of bored irritation.  You coulda just said no  he mumbled nodding towards the figure in front of me and flying away toward the top of a nearby hill.   I had just managed to start a fire when the man woke up. His first panicked movements including kicking dirt all over my hard earned fire. I got him again, but softer this time - well, a little softer. He woke up again before I managed to get another fire lit. I considered hitting him one last time, but decided it'd feel better if I waited for him to annoy me again first. I sat him up and he looked up at me morosely.  Where are we?  I demanded. He stayed silent as he tried to shuffle away from both me and the question. I dragged him back by a scrawny ankle.  Where are we?  I asked again, keeping him focussed with a swift rap to the side of the head.  No?  He answered cryptically, changing it to an equally unhelpful  Yes?  When I hit him again. I pulled his bag toward me and pulled out its contents. A small rag of fabric contained a hastily drawn map of the area in something that was n't chocolate.'Bird's hill' and'My hill' were fairly self explanatory, though'Devil's hill' and'Pain hill' were certainly worrying. I dragged him up onto the hill he'd marked as his and easily found his little nest hollowed out of the dirt. I reached around under the dried dirt and found a few unfortunately recognisable bones and a old tattered journal. By the smell of the latter, I concluded that it again was written in not-chocolate."
