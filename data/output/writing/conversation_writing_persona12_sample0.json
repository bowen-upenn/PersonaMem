    "Original Sample": "Back in those days, combat was a real thing. You know, not just like something you watch in movies or read in books. It was sooo real, man. It totally consumed our ability to think diplomatically. There was this mom and her 17-year-old son, and they were going through this lot filled with war machines that hadn't been touched in forever! The mom owned it 'cause she came from some hardcore military family or whatever. But she didn't really go there\u2014she wasn't into that part of her past. So she only went 'cause her kid, who is like totes gonna be a history major or something, would totally dig something like this. Like, if you were born years ago, you'd be at that age where they'd send dudes off to war. The mom said that while lighting up a cigarette. The kid totally knew this stuff (since he\u2019s into history and all), but he just let his mom feel like she's the wise one here. He couldn't imagine being alive back then. It must've been insane. The horrors, am I right? His mom was all, \"Horrible.\" There were these young guys dying for reasons they probably couldn't even understand. They did stuff they didn't want to just to make a living. Was that even fair? She sighed. No way, it wasn't fair. Old politicians making young people do their dirty work\u2014it\u2019s so unfair, isn't it? The boy knew that history was full of stories where many people's sacrifices only helped a few, which is kinda how it rolls, or used to until things changed. Now, people live in like peace, not poverty. They roll in cash, not chaos. Sure, the news is filtered, and everything's tightly controlled, but it's small potatoes for saving so many lives, right? Turning to an old tank with a literal tree growing outta it, the boy noticed it was beat up\u2014probably ate too many bullets but didn\u2019t go down. Its paint was almost all gone except some rusty red bits in front. And this tree, man, bright green and new, like hope or something. More leaves would grow in time. They always do. The mom kept going, \u201cI remember when I could switch channels and watch whatever I wanted. There were loads of news stations, Billy. All of them with different takes. They could say whatever with zero consequences. Freedom, that\u2019s what they called it.\u201d She took a long drag and smiled at him. \u201cThey used that as an excuse to send those boys to die.\u201d Way in the distance, there was a gunshot. Then sirens, and another shot, followed by a woman's cry. Democracy, the boy thought, is slow and costs a lot. But is this really the better option?",
