    "Original Sample": "The stench of decay guided him there. That sickening, cloyingly sweet smell followed him throughout the forest, until the small cottage was in sight. The first thing he noticed was the bodies, hanging from the trees. His jaw tightened, and he slowly slid the silver sword from it's sheath on his back.   This was what he had been searching for, the source of the killings.   Every time he arrived at one of the sites, he had only found bodies hanging there, and an abandoned home or camp. He had almost given up hope on finding the cause of them. This, however, was fresh. Some of the bodies still dripping.   He slowly stalked across the clearing, towards the house. He hoped that what he was hunting would not be inside. Bursting through a doorway would rob him all of the initiative, not to mention any traps or preparations his quarry might have. As he approached the building, he carefully looked in one of the windows. Nothing. No light, no movement. He checked a sigh of relief that might reveal him and continued around the building.   He stopped suddenly, upon rounding a corner of the building. There was his prey. From this distance it appeared to be a woman, but even now, he could see the blood stains on her dress. He slowly started to creep towards her, the bodies of her victims looming over his head. Each step was measured and placed gently on the ground. There was no cover, no safe way to approach. Every step he made, he thought she would spin around, the words of some demonic chant on her lips. Sweat beaded on his forehead. He remembered the talk he had heard in the nearby town, the bounty being offered for the head of the  witch in the forest . He also remembered the boasting of the bounty hunters and sellswords there, claiming she would be an easy prize to take.   Most of their bodies hung in the trees with the others.   As he drew closer, he noticed that she seemed to be looking down, staring at some of the common meadow flowers that were in the area. He tightened his grip on his sword as he closed the last few yards. His heart was hammering so hard he thought she must surely hear it, but his head remained calm. She would die.   He took a single bound, his boot hitting the dirt hard enough to alert her. She spun around, but his sword was already in motion. He looked into eyes that once sparkled with life, but now glowed red with hate. He saw a mouth that once laughed and sung, now locked in a sneer. He saw a young girl, consumed by something she could never have imagined in her darkest nightmares.   His heart twinged with pity. His swing did not falter.   Her head made a lazy arc through the air, before hitting the ground with a muffled thud, her body following, collapsing like a marionette with its strings cut. The blood pouring out of her smoked slightly, and drowned the meadow flowers.   Geralt stood there for a long while, watching the blood soak into the dirt. Pity had never been an emotion he had much use for, but he felt like it was proper here. Finally, he picked up her head, and put it into a sack he had hanging on his belt. He walked out of the clearing without once looking back.",
