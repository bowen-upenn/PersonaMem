    "Original Sample": "Tony woke to the sound of his i-ear vibrating through his skull, a sound that only he could hear. \u201c Up and at em \u201d his i-companion IRIS kept repeating blandly to him. \u201c It \u2019 s 5.55am and time to get up. Today is another chance for you to change the world! You have over slept 5 minutes ; that \u2019 s 5 minutes of your life you will never get back. 5 minutes a day over the course of an average male life-span is 29,382.5 minutes, or 489.71 hours, or 20.40 days, or a little under three weeks. Imagine what you could accomplish with an extra three weeks. You owe it to yourself, your family, your community and Team Australia to make the most of the life you have \u201d. Tony groaned inwardly at IRIS \u2019 s continual prompting, careful to not fully articulate the thoughts in his mind, wary of the consequences of thinking his own mind. He hardly even noticed the inane advertisement that seemed to be uttered as an afterthought \u201c These figures have proudly been brought to you by Toggle \u2122. TOGGLE : Providing the thoughts you never knew you knew \u201c. He was getting better at ignoring his own thoughts, carefully suppressing the wry smile before it could form on his lips. You could never be too careful, the algorithms that powered ASIO \u2019 s ( Australian Security Intelligence Organisation ) semi-AI \u2018 A-BOT \u2019 were ever watchful and incredibly sensitive to subversive actions and thoughts.  Tony rolled out of bed and lithely launched himself into his first hundred jumping jacks, careful to perform them correctly. The last thing he needed was IRIS \u2018 helpfully \u2019 providing him instruction and correction on proper form and the following lecture on the physical and moral dangers of mediocrity to himself, his family, his community and Team Australia. As he started on the treadmill Tony emptied his mind and focused completely on doing. So completely was his absorption in doing, he barely noticed the advertisements that whispered inside his skull every 6 minutes, switching between informing him which deodorant was perfect for him, and reminding him that it was everybody \u2019 s duty to look out for Team Australia in every action and thought. \u201c Exercise complete in five minutes and fifteen seconds, prepare for warm-down \u201d IRIS said. Tony jerked himself back from his non-thoughts and prepared for the treadmill to slow down with his heart rate, bringing his heart carefully back to his normal 60 beats per minute. As the treadmill slowed to a slow walking pace, IRIS began to provide him with an analysis of his performance. \u201c Reached 87 % of VO2 maximum, 91 % of maximum heart rate. Your session was above your long term average. Congratulations. A perfect person makes a perfect team. A perfect team makes a perfect Australia \u201d. \u201c Thank you IRIS \u201d he thought to the i-ear.  What is my schedule for today \u201d? He thought walking towards his insta-cleaner. \u201c 7.01 \u2013 7.02 Insta-clean. 7.03 get dressed. 7.05 travel to mess hall. 7.10 breakfast. 7.30 meeting with 042-948-202-881. \u201d IRIS responded.  Tony was so surprised he verbally said \u201c IRIS please repeat last appointment \u201d. \u201c 7.30 meeting with 042-948-202-881. \u201d IRIS repeated. Careful not to think in words Tony thought quickly. \u201c When was this appointment made IRIS? You did not mention it and I couldn \u2019 t see it in my calendar \u201d. As he was thinking this to IRIS Tony was checking the calendar in his HUD. Sure enough there the appointment was. 7.30am with 042-948-202-881. In micro seconds Tony had already mentally brought up his Toggle \u2122 search engine and was performing multiple searches for any publicly available information on 042-948-202-881. \u201c This appointment was made three years ago. It was specifically hidden from your HUD \u2019 s calendar and I was prevented from informing you \u201d. Tony felt a chill down his spine. A 04 secretly made an appointment with him years ago? As he waited for Toggle \u2122 he queried IRIS again \u201c Are there any notes attached with this appointment \u201d? \u201c I \u2019 m sorry Tony, but I am unable to help you further \u201d. In the silence following this ominous pronouncement Toggle \u2122 started bringing back its results.   To be continued...",
