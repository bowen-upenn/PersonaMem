    "Original Sample": "We had not seen another living person in three days.   My heart skipped a beat when he approached us in his torn up windbreaker and leather cap. He held out his bloody hands to us and smiled.   The initial point of impact was Dodger Stadium, so all of that is gone now. I lived 15 minutes by bus from there, but that morning I was on the Red Line underground and making my way toward Hollywood.   The explosion gently rocked the train car. There were sixty of us on the car that morning, a mixed crowd of school children, dental assistants, lawyers, chefs, and others on their way to work. We pried open the subway car doors after the power went out and all of us were holding our cellphones to light the way. The conductor at the end of the car was a woman named Martha, in her late thirties, tapping on her dead radio. She led us to an access stairwell with her flashlight.   We surfaced somewhere near Koreatown, at least seven stops away from my lawyer's office where I was going to sign my divorce papers. None of that matters now. All the buildings that were not instantly destroyed were on fire, and even the streets were smoldering with intense heat. The air was thick with ash. Oddly I felt a chill run down my back. The children on their way to school were fascinated and began taking pictures with their phones. An older man in his eighties held his cigarette to a burning mail box. Some of the men in the group began to cry, while the women made bold, vocal plans to walk home.   Someone suggested wrapping our faces in our shirts, sweaters. I fashioned two scarves from my book bag and firmly wrapped it over my nose and mouth.    There's a police station down on Vermont,  Martha said motioning south with her flashlight. All of us simply shook our heads. What use would a building, police or otherwise, make in a situation like this? They probably did n't have any warnings, or a chance to make their way into any type of shelters.   We were lucky. Stupid lucky, really. A cosmic lottery. But we had nowhere else to go.   More than half of the group decided that they were going to walk home and that's when the arguing began. Some in Spanish, Cantonese, and even a few French profanities. A man who only gave his name as Dan the Lawyer shouted at the Mexican women that they were gambling with their lives if they were going to try and walk back home.   But none of Dan's logic held water for those people who were going to go after their children at school, or their loved ones at home. They simply wanted to be with people they knew and not subway strangers.   The police station was a husk, a frame with melted girders jutting from the ground. What looked like an armored truck was resting on its side. We stood across the street for twenty minutes staring at the rubble. A woman from our group, maybe in nurse's scrubs, I do n't remember, opened her giant purse and handed out sliced apples, water and crackers to us. At this point there were only about 15 of us in the group.    I was on my way to a health fair at a school in North Hollywood,  the woman slowly said as though she were looking for our permission to eat the food.   The old man who lit his cigarette on the embers of a burning mail box wandered off and two men went running after him. He was an older man, Mexican, with a permanent scowl on his face and a thick, white mustache. He waved off the group a number of times, but we kept on him to stay with us.  It's all farts,  he would say and we found ourselves laughing at his reaction to our situation.   Night crept up on us. There was no sunset or presence of a transition. In the distance we heard helicopters, but they did not come near us as we settled ourselves into a park. The children, ranging from middle school to high school, slept near a burning tree trunk. Martha walked over to me and whispered,  I'm not sure which direction to go to next.    I shook my head and heard myself say,  To the coast? Maybe one of the naval bases.    We had no idea what that decision meant at the time. In the morning six from our group did not wake up and another woman died when we turned west on Pico. She simply toppled over and we left her on the street, because there was nowhere to bury her. We saw more rubble, more burning cars, buildings and bodies arranged in various poses along the sidewalk. Pico's impression of Pompeii included the golden arches of fast food, storefront churches, and the husks of the largest animals in the city - the buses.   I noticed myself sneezing more often, then vomiting. My scarves were bloodied by the start of the second day. Martha's radio began to chirp. Dan the Lawyer began to convulse and we tried to make him comfortable, because that's all that we could do. The day grew colder, darker. The radio beeped one more time, but it was a garbled voice, bleating with instructions that we could n't follow.   Martha said shivering next to me on the second night,  My girlfriend is in Barbados. She begged me to take time off to go with her. She and I had only been going out for a few months.     My husband was filing for divorce, but... So I'm married until the end of time. Which is n't too far from now.    The younger school children slowed down on the third morning. The older man with his cigarette was awake before the rest of us, making his way south for some reason. We were all too tired to chase him. I thought I heard a dog bark, then a cow cry out. One of the other men said he could see a pack of mice on the street, but none of us were sure where he was pointing.   Exhaustion forced the older women to fall to their knees and cry out to the sky. They began to pray and gently sob while holding their bosoms. I bought my scarves on the Amalfi Coast in Southern Italy, though I can no longer make out their patterns. Martha held a tuft of her hair and let it go in the wind. One of the younger boys, maybe 14, was holding his friend over his shoulder, a streak of stomach bile running down his back.   Then he emerged from the afternoon dust and greeted us each with a smile. He handed us triangles of sandwiches wrapped in newspaper and whispered into my ear,  With great power comes great responsibility.    His teeth were caked with soot, and he walked with a limp, but slung over his shoulder was a satchel full of food. Without waiting for a response he shuffled off to the east. We stared in disbelief and wondered if we had it so bad after all.    Who the hell was that?  I whispered to Martha.    Probably my father. I never knew him. ",
