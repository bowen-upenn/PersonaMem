    "Original Sample": " What's protocol Christmas?  Said Sam.    What?  Asked Stacey.    Protocol Christmas, your computer seems to be initiating it.  Replied Sam.    No,  interjected Stephen,  it was protocol swiss sticks. It clearly said swiss sticks.     You've got gunk in your ears.  said Sam  the voice said Christmas.    Stacey firmly reminded the group.  My computer does n't talk.     It most certainly does,  said Stephen,  and it's looking for swiss sticks.     Christmas,  Sam corrected.   It was at this point the usually reserved Rebecca chimed in,  well... why do n't we ask it?     Ask what?  said Sam, obviously confused.    Ask the computer.  Rebecca clarified, though she was still met with silence.  You know, ask it what it said.     My computer does n't talk.  Stacey said again, asserting her self.    Listen, Stacey, that train has left the station. This computer clearly spoke and we have all accept that as fact. Please catch up to the conversation or wait patiently until we've figured out how to get these swiss sticks.     Christmas.     Excuse me, computer?  whispered Rebecca.   They all stared intently at the machine.   ... yes?     Holy shit,  Stacey was agape.    I do n't know why you're surprised at this point, I told you it was an established fact.     Computer, yes, hello. I am, um, I'm Rebecca, how do you do?    ... well     Ah, yes, excellent. Good to hear, really. So, cutting to the point, quick question. Earlier, you said something about an agent, do you remember that?    ... yes     Good, right, good, good. So, you were initiating a protocol. Was it'Christmas' or'swiss sticks'?   ... sixsmith     Yes! I told you! Swiss sticks. I knew it.     No. Sixsmith.     Sick striss?     Sixsmith     Sizmiss?     Sixsmith     Listen, I know this is n't your fault and it's probably beyond your control but whoever programmed your voice did a horrid job. It's all garbled and electronicy, like how computers sounded in the 70's on bad sci-fi shows.     Hey now,  said Stacey,  I know communication issues are frustrating but there's no reason to take out your anger on my computer, it's just trying to help.     I thought you did n't think it spoke.     It's clearly speaking, Sam. Accept the situation. Accept that I accept the situation.     I accept it.     Good.     Alright, everyone accepts everything so far, good.  Said Stephen, resuming his role of leadership.  Let's get back to the task at hand.     You know what...     Hmm? What's that Mr. Computer?     Just forget it.     What?  said the group.    Aww. No, I'm sorry computer I did n't mean to make fun of your voice. I was just frustrated.     No. It's not that. Listen, just... Just forget I said anything.     But we've accepted it.     Right, yes, I understand that, but we've moved on, we've progressed, and in the place we've moved on to I'm just a normal computer, alright? Alright, I'm going to go now.     Wait,  said Stephen, gently reaching out his hand towards the screen. But the computer did not speak again.   They sat in silence, staring at the machine.   Nothing happened.    Fuck,  said Sam,  now we have to study. ",
