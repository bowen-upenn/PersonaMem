    "Original Sample": "The conference hall had trillions upon trillions of bacteria within its golden walls. All were talking excitedly with one another. The supreme general had just summoned every bacteria on the planet to this meeting. Such a mass gathering could only mean one thing.   The chattering died down as fanfare began to play. The supreme general slowly made his way towards the podium. The crowd was hushed. The wise leader was very old, nearly 6 hours. Whatever he had to say, his subjects would listen.   The general cleared his throat and began to address the crowd.  Greetings to all the loyal bacteria who have traveled so far to be with us tonight.  His voice reverberated throughout the hall.  I have called you all here for one purpose only : tonight, we begin our conquest of the human race.    A roar of approval sprung from the populace, praising their general. He waved a flagellum, and the cries died down immediately.    For centuries, our kind flourished. Along with our friends the viruses, we shortened the unnaturally long lives of the towering giants that made us so miserable. But with the advent of personal hygiene, things have never looked bleaker. Billions of us are destroyed every minute by the cruel practices of hot water, soap, and toothpaste. But no longer! Tonight, the proud people of Bacterium will rise again!    More cheering from the crowd, louder this time. The moment they had been waiting for, the dream passed from their ancestors of past days and even weeks, to make the humans pay for their crimes.   Speaking over the noise, the general laid out his plan.  In five minutes' time, the surgeon general of the United States of America will pass this very conference hall. At that moment, I will lead you all in a glorious attack. We will swarm the surgeon's body and infect his very brain. But we will not kill him.    Confused shouts emanated from the bacteria. The general smiled and said,  No, we will not kill him. That would be a hollow victory indeed. This battle will be the future of bacteria itself. You see, my scientists have developed the technology to control the minds of an infected host. We will take control of the surgeon general!    Suddenly, the supreme general looked somber.  This victory will not come without a price. The sanitizer the surgeon general uses is effective against 99.9 % of bacteria. By my calculations, only about 40 of us will survive.    The hall was abruptly silent. The people here had lived among billions of their kind their entire life. The thought of just 40 remaining was unbearable to them.    But I believe it is a price worth paying,  the leader said.  The remaining bacteria will be able to bring the entire world under our control. All I ask now is : will you do this?    The members of the crowd murmured amongst each other for several seconds, and then, with seemingly one mind, all agreed : it was for the greater good.   Suddenly, the massive footfalls of a human could be heard. The general said,  It's time! The glorious revolution of bacteria is at hand!  And with determination, he lead the charge onto the human's leg.",
