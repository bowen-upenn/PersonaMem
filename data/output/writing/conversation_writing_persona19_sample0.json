    "Original Sample": "Jonathan Conroe bound up the grated steps, placing his hand on an illuminated LCD screen with a rough outline of a human hand displaying upon it. A pinprick to his thumb as his key to the mobile lab. It was bitter cold in Antarctica and they had coffee inside...  Men in lab coats rushed to greet him as he took off the heavy layers clothing.  High fellas. What do we have here?  He asked the head geek.   Well sir, we recovered a body from the lab we lost last month... sort of .    Sort of..have a *body*? I was under the impression this was an interview.   Yes, and if the didnt brief you with all the details, the next few minutes are going to be very confusing for you. We're still putting the pieces together but whats in that room is impossible.   What's in the room? I was told this was an interview with an adult man in his late thirties to ascertain his identity and origins.  John said with a lack of patience.    Very well John. I think you'll understand why you were shipped out to the ass-end of the planet to talk to a guy. It'll all become clear in a moment .  John was led down a sterile hallway, through no less than 5 decontamination washes. They stopped at a heavy pressure sealed vault door of a type he'd never seen. It opened, and he heard the voice... A very familiar voice. One of Johns best friends and coworkers was locked in a giant aquarium, hands pressed against the glass to get a glimpse of the outside world. Boredom does that.    *JESUS, *JOHN* thank fucking God!  The exhausted man shouted through the thick acrylic wall separating him from John and the swarm of tech and researchers studying him.   Ben? Benny! What the fuck are you doing here!? What in gods name did you get yourself into?   Bengimin Cameron. Father of 3, married 16 years, outstanding officer and highly credentialed researcher was in an giant fish tank, oddly wearing the worn out civies he normally walked around in.    Holy shit Ben! Gim me 15 mins and I'll figure out what the fuck happened here. Heads will role for this bud. Count on it.   John cornered the senior researcher, Dr. Gregg Horihito and demanded details.    Why the fuck is he in there? I dint even see a goddamned toilet! You better have a *damn* good reason for this, or its your ass!     OK, just... relax, alright? Give me a chance to ease you into this. I-  I dont want to be eased into it. Tell me what the fuck is going on.    Horihito signed, took off his glasses to wipe the lenses, stalling...   Thats not guy you know. Its an alien analog.  The Dr. said as calmly as he could.  Bullshit . Ive known that guy 20 years, Christ he comes to my Christmas parties and coaches a Little League team back home. My son is on his team for Christs sake-   Horihito cut him off.  Your friend in there? Was found in 18 very frozen and very dead tissue samples. They apparently migrated into a single mass. It began with all manner of horrific physiology before settling on this one. Then it asked for you directly.   So he's still in there. His brain is still sharp and he seems to be the same guy I took fishing last year, except he's scared out of his wits.    do you want to see the footage of how he came to look like that?     No- maybe later  John replied softly.  So why me?  Lots of good guys have the same quality skill sets and are much cheaper. They'll likely put up with your shitty coffee as well .   Its because you know him. We dont know how much of the memory carried over during an *event*. We dont fully understand how its transferred from host to host, and the big one : WE DONT KNOW HOW THEY PASS FOR HUMANS!  They go fucking undetected until its too late. We need protocols to determine who's really who . Its your job to find out how far the rabbit hole this goes. Is it instinct? Is the fucking thing *that* smart?  He followed with :  You have 6 hours. After that we will freeze the sample and preserve it for study. Learn what you can about its mind.     John! The muffled yell radiated from the containment chamber. John approached the glass.    remember that epic poker game just before your wedding? You promised a rematch before I die. If I end up a crispy critter, please tell everybody I won this match. Hell, maybe I'll get luck and win so I can take that little victory with me . He paused a second, tears in his eyes.     It really is the little things you miss when you know its coming.
