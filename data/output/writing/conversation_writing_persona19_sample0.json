    "Original Sample": "This tale opens with an indistinct voice narrating something resembling a fable, which ends up being somewhat difficult to follow as specifics about characters are missing and genders aren't specified. Anyway, to sum it up, some parts of this are about the gods, but then it suddenly shifts, and we're introduced to a hero without much fanfare or connection to the previous bits mentioned about gods earlier on. Alongside this, everything is presented in one long paragraph, which feels like it never ends, with multiple ideas and concepts layered on top of one another without breaks, and the whole narrative comes across as a monotonous stream of thought. No sections guide the reader through, meaning it becomes easy to get lost as topics shift abruptly from what the gods might represent to some supposed champions and potential combats. Overall, the narrative lacks any form of structure or excitement, turning the tale into a ramble more than anything else. Vague ideas hang without any tangible evidence or elaboration, and perhaps it should've had a more straightforward approach to the unfolding plot.",
