    "Original Sample": "Danica saw the Peak first. The finger of jutting rock at the outskirts of the village where she, Michael and Zara used to play. There was a second tree growing on the peak, lending it an unbalanced look. She decided she didn \u2019 t like it.   *High vantage point, unused for defensive purposes despite perfect positioning. Cut down trees, create watchtower. Supply with signal flags and place relay positions in village and on hillside above Crossroads. Lack of use almost criminally negligent. *   The fields nearby were still familiar though. Low stone walls, roughly stacked and crudely mortared. More markers than serious fortifications, they surrounded waving golden fields of maize and wheat. The harvest would be three weeks, perhaps four away. The womenfolk would be planning the feast while the menfolk would be sharpening their scythes.   Farmer Donal \u2019 s house appeared at the edge of a rise, partially hidden by the landscape and the forested hillside. A thin streamer of lazy smoke rose in the calm, warm air. The house was occupied. She remembered the cherry pies and furious-yet-amused scolding from Goodwoman Donal when Michael made off with one of them.   *Perfect forward defense post. Hidden, yet within sight of vantage points. Ideal for stable locations for fast horse transfers, or guard post to rapidly respond to trouble on the roads. *   As recently as ten years ago, the sight of the little cottage had provoked a twinge of homesickness, a brief wonder if the Orphanage Mother had forgiven her words \u2013 and then a renewed determination to get to Crossroads and the recruiting station. Now however\u2026Danica frowned as the home vanished behind a copse of trees and she felt absolutely nothing past vague disapproval.   The wooden palisade wall of the outer village was now ahead of her, and her mercenary-trained eyes noted the dark dots of a patrol moving along it. In her youth, that mighty construct of hewn logs had seemed so safe and secure. But now she looked at them again with a practiced eye.   *Woods provide ample cover. Small guerrilla forces infiltrate, surround and use Fire Arrows from three directions. Exhaust defenders with firefighting, then send fresh mounted units up main road. While defenders distracted, slip woodclimbers over logs and poison supplies. *   Her mount shifted underneath her, and Danica sent a reassuring pat through its mane. The Cragcat was a mental predator, and its faint thoughts resonated with hers. A wondering query manifested \u2013 \u2018 is the village ahead prey? \u2019   Danica replied that it was not, but she sensed dissatisfaction from the \u2018 cat. It could tell when she lied to herself, and despite it being her hometown, Danica could only look at the defenses and imagine how she would breach them.   A shout rose from the \u2018 wall \u2019 and she winced at the sloppy challenge.   *No request for identification. No direction or armament information. Nothing about the Cragcat. A commander with that man for a watcher would be woefully unprepared from his complete lack of useful intelligence. *   Danica \u2019 s practiced eye mentally judged the distance and began counting it off in her head. At about six hundred yards, she looked right and then left. She frowned in disappointment.   *Easily within longbow shot range. No markers at six hundred feet. Sloppy. No way to range weapons. *   She was a bare three hundred feet from the wide open gate when the watcher finally directed a challenge to her.   \u201c Ho! Traveller! Where be your destination? \u201d   *Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. No challenge words, no question about origins \u2013 which is vastly more important than destination. And still no questions about the Cragcat*. Danica could feel the beast shift uneasily again. It sent another projection \u2013 \u2018 are you *sure* that these aren \u2019 t prey? They \u2019 re acting like it \u2019. Again she reassured it.   She passed through the open gates, giving them only the barest of vexed frowns. What was the point of an open gate? *And that timber looked very, very dry. Dangerously dry. *   Still her mount remained unchallenged. The watchers stared at it, and the shouts of children playing died away, to be replaced with awed whispers. Danica kept a firm mental rein on the \u2018 cat \u2019 s thoughts. Her eyes skipped immediately to an imposing structure to her left. The Orphanage. A strange woman sat on the steps with the orange scarf of a Mother, and Danica \u2019 s heart twisted in mixed regret and relief.   Mother Superior was long gone if she let someone else wear that scarf here.  She was glad that she wouldn \u2019 t have to meet with the shrew again\u2026and at the same time, Danica regretted that she wouldn \u2019 t meet with the shrew again.   She arrived at the small fountain that marked the center of the village. It hadn \u2019 t changed much \u2013 a little bit mossier, and it looked like the top basin was still cracked. Villagers were beginning to stream out of their houses, flooding into the center, coming to have a look at the visitor.   *Their thatch-roofed houses. Not nearly enough water in the fountain to put out the fires \u2013 and nowhere near enough for that new inn. No quick-close shutters on windows, no water and sand troughs. *   A man hurried out of the large \u2018 town hall \u2019. Danica gave a start as she recognized the features. Michael. Memories burst over her \u2013 lazy summer days in the fields, at the Peak, by the creek. The promises to always be friends. Her youthful admiration for the boy who was older and stronger than her. The secret crush.   Those memories clashed terribly with the overweight, pot-bellied man in front of her. His \u2018 robes of office \u2019 were more reminiscent of a pauper \u2019 s begging get-up. The Gold Chain of Office was tarnished, speaking of a man who didn \u2019 t care for his belongings\u2026and judging by the thinness of several of the villagers, someone who didn \u2019 t care for his people either. His voice was reedy, whiny\u2026annoying.   \u201c Who are you? Why have you come here? \u201d   Danica took one final look at the woefully unprepared village. In a way, the lack of recognition from her childhood friend helped cement a decision that had been brewing for a while. She felt the final ties fall away\u2026and pure freedom blossomed through her.   She swung easily off the \u2018 cat, booted feet landing on the rough cobbles in a practiced dismount. Her leather armor creaked comfortingly, and she reached for her hip. Her hand passed over her shortsword and plucked off the scroll attached to her belt.   \u201c I am Danica Warsworn of the Goldwing Mercenary Company. I \u2019 m here to deliver a message from the King. All able-bodied men are to report to Ashwood for the defense of the Kingdom. This call to arms is non-negotiable and is to be ignored at your own peril. The Enemy marches upon us. \u201d   Frantic whispers broke out around her as the assembled villagers repeated the proclamation around them. Pointless \u2013 they were already all there to hear it in the first place.  Danica stood tall at the center of the crowd, one hand on the Cragcat and realized that indeed, she was no longer one of them. The mayor looked at her more closely.   \u201c Danica? There used to be someone here by that name. But she left a long time ago. Do you know her? \u201d   Danica looked down at the man, a small-time leader of a tiny insignificant village.   \u201c No. This village is not my home. \u201d "
