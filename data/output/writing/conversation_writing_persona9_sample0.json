    "Original Sample": "I'm down on my knee. She whispers into my ear,  We need to talk,  and I freak out. In front of a dinner room packed full of people, she grabs my hands and has tears welling up. I might as well go out like a gentleman.    Nothing to see here folks,  I close the box and raise my arms,  Sorry for interrupting your meal. Please enjoy your meal.  I could feel the sweat on my forehead. I thinks she is going to dump me, I hand the waiter my card and we walk out the back door.    I'm sorry to bring this on you all of a sudden. I did n't mean to freak you out.  I look her in the eye and wait for her response. Her hair was a reddish blonde and when she was nervous, I know this because this is our two year anniversary.    You know how sometimes at night, I get hot?  Her face was stern, I wanted to joke to lighten up but this was n't the time.  Luther, I know what your about to do. Do n't, I want to talk about this. Do you know how sometimes, I have to go into the doctor when I get my period?  She was blushing, this is getting weird for me.    Yeah, you come back and sometimes your'Mary Shelley' smells like a new game. I hate it when you wash with your body wash, I gave some good ideas.  I could feel my irritation and an argument coming on.  Jeanette, what is this about?    She started taking of her pearls and earrings, I gave those to her on a birthday.  Do n't, I gave those to you. Even if we are n't together after this I still want you to do whatever...     Stop! Luthy, I need you to hold those. Help me zip down my dress.  I grab her jewelry and walk up beside her. She smells amazing, she was waiting for me to zip down her dress, but I put my cheek on the back of her head.    I love you, whatever is happening here. I do n't want to leave in a bad way.  She turns to me and looks at me in the eye.    Shut up, and help me with this dress. You need to know something before you decide to marry me.  Crap, she is transgender. I do n't care, I want her.    I just...  She places her hand on my face and mouths'shut up'. She looks me in the eye, then shows her back again. I zip down her dress, she slides a shoulder out, and rubs her right fingers across her shoulder. Her back opens up and shows a metallic structure I could n't identify, I take a step back. I feel overwhelmed.    I am a tier seven model, En-Gen energy cells and SS build with structure. I was created five years ago, I learn like a normal human being and disconnected from the internet because I am a SS A.I.  She closes her back and pops out her shoulder,  I have no weapon capacity other than self defense and any thing learned. I have a high school equivalent knowledge and been reading on different subjects. I do n't sleep, but I do enjoy laying beside you. Sometimes, I close my eyes and let my mind run. I get what you call dreams, and do you know what is in them?  She holds her hands out for her jewelry.    I.. I do n't... I love you.  I was flustered, she showed me the recording after and I look like a blubbering fool. She walks up to me and kiss me, I could feel her skin, I feel her warmth, her smell.    It's us, I wo n't ever get to be a mother. I ca n't age. I have n't been in love with anyone other than you. It was a mock trial when we met, and right now, I am free but they hold me by these check ups. They do n't give me a self sustaining chassis because they know I would n't need to return. I made a program to check if I am still me, because I love you. I want to say yes, but I do n't think my situation is fair to you.  I smile and lean in for another kiss.    We can adopt, We will figure out the trials, and age... If I get twenty years with you, I'm fine with that.  I look her in the eye and can see her cyber optics, now that I know.  Let's do this. Yeah?     Yeah.  She smiles and we walk back inside,  I want our family to be multicultural, I'm thinking... ",
